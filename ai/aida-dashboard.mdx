## Dashboard Sections

### Performance Overview

The top-level view shows aggregate metrics over a configurable time period:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approval Rate** | Percentage of approved transactions |
| **Approval Lift** | Improvement vs. pre-Aida baseline |
| **Total Revenue Recovered** | Revenue from transactions approved via retry |
| **Cost Savings** | Savings from optimized provider selection |
| **Transactions Processed** | Total volume processed through Aida |

### Provider Performance

Compare provider performance side-by-side:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Provider** | Provider name |
| **Volume** | Transaction count routed to this provider |
| **Approval Rate** | Provider-specific approval rate |
| **Avg. Cost** | Average processing cost per transaction |
| **Aida Score** | AI-calculated quality score (0-100) |

### Retry Analytics

Detailed breakdown of Aida's retry performance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Retries Attempted** | Total soft-decline retries |
| **Retries Succeeded** | Successfully recovered transactions |
| **Recovery Rate** | Percentage of successful retries |
| **Avg. Retry Latency** | Additional time added by retry flow |
| **Top Recovery Paths** | Most effective provider failover combinations |

### Recommendations

Aida generates actionable recommendations based on observed patterns:

<Accordion title="Example: Add a new provider">
"Transactions from Brazil with Mastercard have a 15% higher decline rate than Visa. Adding Provider X (which has 95% Mastercard approval in BR) could improve overall approval by 3-5%."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Adjust retry strategy">
"Retry attempts for transactions over $500 have a 5% recovery rate vs. 35% for under $500. Consider limiting retries for high-value transactions to reduce latency."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Cost optimization opportunity">
"Provider A and Provider B have equivalent approval rates for US card transactions, but Provider B costs 0.3% less per transaction. Shifting 50% of US traffic to Provider B could save $X/month."
</Accordion>

## Filtering

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Time Period** | Last 24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, custom range |

3. Set traffic split percentage
4. Monitor results in the AI Dashboard
5. Promote the winner to 100% traffic
