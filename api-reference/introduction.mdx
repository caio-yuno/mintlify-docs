## Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Sandbox | `https://api-sandbox.y.uno` |
| Production | `https://api.y.uno` |

## Authentication

All API requests require three headers:

<Snippet file="auth-headers.mdx" />

See the [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication) page for details on obtaining and managing API keys.

## Common Response Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Resource created |
| 400 | Invalid request — check the error object for details |
| 401 | Authentication failed — verify your API keys |
| 403 | Forbidden — payment method not enabled or permission denied |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded — implement exponential backoff |
| 500 | Server error — retry or contact Yuno support |

## Error Format

All errors return a JSON object:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_FIELD",
    "message": "customer.document is required for PIX"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

Yuno enforces rate limits per API key to ensure platform stability. Limits vary by endpoint category:

| Endpoint Category | Limit | Window |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout Sessions (create/update) | 100 requests | 60 seconds |
| Payments (create/capture/cancel/refund) | 100 requests | 60 seconds |
| Customers (CRUD) | 200 requests | 60 seconds |
| List endpoints (GET) | 200 requests | 60 seconds |
| Webhooks (register) | 50 requests | 60 seconds |

Rate limit information is included in every API response via the following headers:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum number of requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the current window resets |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying (only present on `429` responses) |

If you receive a `429` response, implement exponential backoff retry logic. Use the `Retry-After` header value as the minimum wait time before retrying.

## Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination with `limit`, `starting_after`, and `ending_before` query parameters.
