title: "Unenroll Payment Method"
openapi: "DELETE /v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods/{payment_method_id}"
---

Remove an enrolled payment method. The method's status changes to `UNENROLLED` and its `vaulted_token` can no longer be used for payments.

## When to use

Call this endpoint when a customer wants to remove a saved payment method, when a card has expired, or when you need to clean up unused vaulted tokens. The payment method is soft-deleted: the record remains but is no longer usable.

## Authentication

<Note>
Requires both `public-api-key` and `private-secret-key` headers. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.
</Note>

## Request example

<Info>
The actual unenroll API path is `POST /v1/customers/payment-methods/{payment_method_id}/unenroll`. Note that it does **not** include `customer_id` in the path and uses `POST`, not `DELETE`. The OpenAPI spec maps the `DELETE` operation for documentation purposes.

## Notes

<Warning>
Unenrollment is a soft delete. The `vaulted_token` becomes invalid for payments, but the record persists in the system. The method will no longer appear in [List Enrolled Payment Methods](/api-reference/payment-methods/list).
</Warning>

- The actual API path is `POST /v1/customers/payment-methods/{payment_method_id}/unenroll` -- it does **not** include `customer_id` in the path, unlike other payment method endpoints.
- Re-enrolling the same card after unenrollment creates a new enrollment with a new `vaulted_token`.
- Any in-flight payments using the old `vaulted_token` may still complete, but new payments will be rejected.

## Related endpoints

- [Enroll Payment Method](/api-reference/payment-methods/enroll) -- vault a new payment method
- [List Enrolled Payment Methods](/api-reference/payment-methods/list) -- verify the method no longer appears after unenrollment
- [Retrieve Payment Method](/api-reference/payment-methods/get) -- check the method's status
- [Delete Customer](/api-reference/customers/delete) -- remove the customer entirely (also invalidates all payment methods)
