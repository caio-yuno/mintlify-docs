title: "Retrieve Payment by Merchant Order ID"
openapi: "GET /v1/payments/merchant-order-id/{merchant_order_id}"
---

Retrieve one or more payments associated with a specific merchant order identifier. Returns an array of payment objects matching the given order ID.

## When to use

Use this endpoint to look up payments using your own order identifiers instead of Yuno's payment IDs. This is useful for order management systems, customer support lookups, and reconciliation workflows where you track orders by your internal IDs.

## Authentication

| Header | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public-api-key` | string | Yes | Your public API key from the Yuno dashboard |
| `private-secret-key` | string | Yes | Your private secret key from the Yuno dashboard |

## Request example

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/merchant-order-id/order-1234 \
  -H "public-api-key: YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "private-secret-key: YOUR_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
const merchantOrderId = "order-1234";

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/merchant-order-id/${merchantOrderId}`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "public-api-key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
      "private-secret-key": "YOUR_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY",
    },
  }
);

const payments = await response.json();
// Returns an array -- may contain multiple payments
```

```python Python
import requests

merchant_order_id = "order-1234"

response = requests.get(
    f"https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/merchant-order-id/{merchant_order_id}",
    headers={
        "public-api-key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
        "private-secret-key": "YOUR_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY",
    },
)

payments = response.json()
# Returns a list -- may contain multiple payments
```

</CodeGroup>

## Key parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `merchant_order_id` | string | Yes | Path parameter. Your order identifier used when creating the payment |

## Response

A successful request returns a `200` status code with an **array** of payment objects. Each item has the same structure as the [Get Payment](/api-reference/payments/get) response (wrapped in a `payment` key).

        }
      ],
      "workflow": "DIRECT",
      "metadata": []
    }
  }
]
```

<Warning>
This endpoint returns an **array** even when only a single payment matches. Multiple payments can share the same `merchant_order_id` (for example, if a first payment attempt was declined and a retry succeeded). Always iterate over the results.
</Warning>

## Error responses

| Status | Code | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 401 | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Missing or invalid API keys | Verify your `public-api-key` and `private-secret-key` headers |
| 403 | `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` | Merchant not authorized | Contact Yuno support to verify your account permissions |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | No payments found for this order ID | Verify the `merchant_order_id` is correct |

## Related endpoints

- [Get Payment](/api-reference/payments/get) - Retrieve a payment by its Yuno payment ID
- [List Payments](/api-reference/payments/list) - List all payments with filters
- [Create Payment](/api-reference/payments/create) - Create a new payment

<Note>
If the same `merchant_order_id` was used across multiple payment attempts (for example, a declined payment followed by a successful retry), all matching payments are returned. Filter by `status` to find the successful one.
