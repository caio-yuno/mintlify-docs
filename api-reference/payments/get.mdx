<Warning>
The response is wrapped in a `payment` key. Access data as `response.payment.status`, not `response.status`. Also, `transactions` is returned as an **array** here, unlike the single object returned by [Create Payment](/api-reference/payments/create).
</Warning>

### Additional fields (not present in Create response)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `idempotency_key` | The idempotency key used when the payment was created |
| `account_code` | Alias for `account_id` |
| `additional_data` | Always present with sub-objects: `airline`, `transportations`, `order`, `seller_details` |
| `taxes` | Tax information (null if not applicable) |
| `payment_link_code` | Payment link code (empty string if payment was not created from a link) |
| `split_marketplace` | Marketplace split payment details at the payment level |

## Error responses

| Status | Code | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `INVALID_PARAMETERS` | Invalid UUID format in path | Ensure `payment_id` is a valid UUID v4 |
| 401 | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Missing or invalid API keys | Verify your `public-api-key` and `private-secret-key` headers |
| 403 | `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` | Merchant not authorized | Contact Yuno support to verify your account permissions |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Payment does not exist | Verify the `payment_id` is correct |
