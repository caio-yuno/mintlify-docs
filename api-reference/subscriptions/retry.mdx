title: "Retry Subscription"
openapi: "POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/retry"
---

Manually retries a failed subscription payment. Useful when a recurring payment was declined and the customer has updated their payment method.

## When to use

Use this endpoint after a subscription payment has failed and you want to trigger an immediate retry. This is commonly used when:

- A customer updates their card details after a decline
- You want to manually retry outside the automatic retry schedule
- A temporary payment processor issue has been resolved

## Authentication

All requests require the following headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `public-api-key` | Your Yuno public API key |
| `private-secret-key` | Your Yuno private secret key |

  -H "private-secret-key: your-secret-key"

    headers={

## Key parameters

```json
{
  "id": "0c7fed3e-ee0d-4d34-9547-778be4ec0798",
  "name": "Premium Monthly Plan",

  "amount": { "currency": "USD", "value": 15000 },

    "total": 12,
    "current": 4,
    "next_at": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000000Z"
  },
  "updated_at": "2024-12-15T14:20:00.000000Z"
}
```

## Error responses

| Status | Description | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| 400 | Subscription does not have a failed payment to retry | Ensure the subscription has a declined payment pending retry |
| 401 | Invalid or missing API keys | Verify `public-api-key` and `private-secret-key` headers |
| 404 | Subscription not found | Confirm the subscription ID exists in your account |

- [Retrieve Subscription](/api-reference/subscriptions/get) -- Check current subscription and payment status
- [Cancel Subscription](/api-reference/subscriptions/cancel) -- Cancel if the customer no longer wants the subscription

For automatic retries, configure the `retries` object when [creating the subscription](/api-reference/subscriptions/create). You can set up to 6 retry attempts with custom delays between each attempt, and optionally stop retries on hard declines.
