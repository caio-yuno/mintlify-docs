## v3.0.0 (September 2025)

### Breaking Changes

<Warning>
v3.0.0 requires minimum SDK 24 (Android 7.0) and Kotlin 1.9+. Update your `minSdk` and Kotlin version before upgrading.
</Warning>

- **Minimum SDK raised** from 21 to 24
- **Kotlin 1.9+ required** (coroutines-based API)
- **New initialization:** `Yuno.initialize()` is now a suspend function
- **Removed:** `YunoCallback` interface (replaced by Kotlin Flow and lambda callbacks)

### Migration from v2.x

```kotlin
// v2.x (removed)
Yuno.initialize(context, "public-key", object : YunoCallback {
    override fun onPaymentSuccess(result: PaymentResult) { }
    override fun onPaymentError(error: YunoError) { }
})

// v3.x (current)
val yuno = Yuno.initialize(
    context = applicationContext,
    publicApiKey = "public-key",
    checkoutSession = "session-id",
    country = "BR",
)
yuno.startCheckout { result ->
    when (result) {
        is PaymentResult.Success -> handleSuccess(result)
        is PaymentResult.Error -> handleError(result)
    }
}
```

### New Features
- Kotlin coroutines and Flow support throughout
- Structured concurrency for lifecycle-safe payment handling
- Jetpack Compose support (experimental)

## v2.x (Legacy)

<Note>
v2.x is deprecated and will reach end-of-life in March 2026. Upgrade to v3.x using the migration guide above. v2.x continues to receive critical security patches only.
</Note>
