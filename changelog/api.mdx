## Migration Guides

<Accordion title="Migrating from /payments/search to /payments">
The `GET /v1/payments/search` endpoint is deprecated. Replace with `GET /v1/payments` using query parameters:

**Before:**
```
GET /v1/payments/search
Body: { "status": "SUCCEEDED", "country": "BR" }
```

**After:**
```
GET /v1/payments?status=SUCCEEDED&country=BR
```

All filter parameters are identical. The new endpoint uses query strings instead of a request body.
</Accordion>

## API Versioning

The current API version is **v1**. All endpoints use the `/v1/` prefix. Breaking changes will introduce a new version (`/v2/`). Non-breaking additions are released under the current version.
