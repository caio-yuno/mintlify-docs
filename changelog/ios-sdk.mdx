    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            YunoCardNumberField()
            YunoExpiryField()
            YunoCVVField()
            Button("Pay") {
                Task {
                    let token = try await yuno.generateToken()
                    // Create payment with token
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
