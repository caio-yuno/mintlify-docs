## Overview

Customer profiles in Yuno store identity information, documents, and associated payment methods. Creating a customer allows you to vault payment methods for returning users and streamline checkout with pre-filled data.

## Creating a Customer

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_customer_id": "your-internal-id-123",
    "first_name": "Maria",
    "last_name": "Silva",
    "email": "maria@example.com",
    "country": "BR",
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    }
  }'
```

The response includes a Yuno-generated `customer_id` that you use in subsequent API calls.

## Customer Identifiers

| Identifier | Source | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `customer_id` | Yuno-generated | Primary key for Yuno API calls |
| `merchant_customer_id` | Your system | Maps to your internal user ID |

<Note>
  Always store the Yuno `customer_id` alongside your internal user ID. You need it to retrieve enrolled payment methods, create one-click payments, and manage the customer profile.
</Note>

## Document Types

Many payment methods -- especially in Latin America -- require customer identification documents. Yuno supports the following document types:

| Document Type | Country | Format | Example |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------|
| `CPF` | Brazil | 11 digits | `12345678901` |
| `CNPJ` | Brazil | 14 digits | `12345678000195` |
| `CC` | Colombia | 6-10 digits | `1234567890` |
| `CE` | Colombia | 6-10 digits | `1234567` |
| `NIT` | Colombia | 9-10 digits | `123456789` |
| `RUT` | Chile | 8-9 chars | `12345678K` |
| `DNI` | Argentina, Peru | 7-8 digits | `12345678` |
| `CURP` | Mexico | 18 chars | `ABCD123456HDFRRL09` |
| `PASSPORT` | Global | Varies | `AB1234567` |

<Warning>
  Document numbers must be sent as digits only (no dots, dashes, or formatting). For example, a CPF of `123.456.789-01` should be sent as `12345678901`.
</Warning>

## Associating Payment Methods

When a customer completes a payment with `"vaulted_token": true`, the payment method is automatically associated with their profile. You can retrieve all enrolled methods for a customer:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```

This returns a list of vaulted payment methods (masked card numbers, PIX keys, etc.) that can be used for one-click checkout.

## Customer in Payments

Include customer details in payment requests to satisfy payment-method-specific requirements:

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "customer_id": "yuno-customer-id",
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    },
    "email": "maria@example.com"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  If you pass `customer_id`, Yuno pulls stored profile data. You can still override specific fields (like `email`) in the same request.
</Note>
