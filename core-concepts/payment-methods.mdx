## Payment-Method-Specific Requirements

Different payment methods require different fields in the payment request.

### Cards

For Direct API integration (PCI-certified merchants), enroll the card first to get a `vaulted_token`:

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "vaulted_token": "cbdcc878-ceb4-4dd8-b0f0-49d444855de0"
  }
}
```

For SDK-based integrations, pass the one-time token from the SDK:

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "token": "tok_4a8b9c2d-1e3f-5678-90ab-cdef12345678"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Handling raw card data via the Direct API requires **PCI DSS compliance**. Use the Yuno SDK with tokenization to avoid PCI scope.
</Warning>

### PIX (Brazil)

```json
{
  "payment_method": { "type": "PIX" },
  "country": "BR",
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00 },
  "customer": {
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
PIX requires `customer.document` with a valid CPF (individuals, 11 digits) or CNPJ (businesses, 14 digits). The response includes a QR code and a copy-paste code for the customer.
</Note>

### Boleto (Brazil)

```json
{
  "payment_method": { "type": "BOLETO" },
  "country": "BR",
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 200.00 },
  "customer": {
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    },
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }
}
```

Boleto payments are asynchronous -- the customer receives a bank slip and pays at a bank branch or online banking. Use [webhooks](/core-concepts/webhooks) to receive the payment confirmation.

### PSE (Colombia)

```json
{
  "payment_method": { "type": "PSE" },
  "country": "CO",
  "amount": { "currency": "COP", "value": 50000 },
  "customer": {
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CC",
      "document_number": "1234567890"
    },
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Enrolling (Vaulting) Payment Methods

To save a payment method for future use, use the Enroll Payment Method endpoint. This requires a [customer profile](/core-concepts/customers).

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods \
  -H "public-api-key: $YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  -H "private-secret-key: $YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: enroll-card-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": "your-account-id",
    "country": "US",
    "type": "CARD",
    "workflow": "DIRECT",
    "card_data": {
      "holder_name": "John Doe",
      "number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiration_month": 12,
      "expiration_year": 2028,
      "security_code": "123"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const enrollment = await fetch(
  `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/${customerId}/payment-methods`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'public-api-key': process.env.YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
      'private-secret-key': process.env.YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
      'X-Idempotency-Key': 'enroll-card-001',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      account_id: 'your-account-id',
      country: 'US',
      type: 'CARD',
      workflow: 'DIRECT',
      card_data: {
        holder_name: 'John Doe',
        number: '4111111111111111',
        expiration_month: 12,
        expiration_year: 2028,
        security_code: '123',
      },
    }),
  }
);

const result = await enrollment.json();
// result.vaulted_token => use this in future payments
```
</CodeGroup>

The enrollment response includes a `vaulted_token` that you can use in future payment requests.

<Note>
If a customer enrolls the same card multiple times, Yuno creates a new enrollment each time with a distinct `vaulted_token`. Use the card `fingerprint` in the response to detect duplicates on your side.
</Note>

## Listing Enrolled Methods

Retrieve all saved payment methods for a customer:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods/{payment_method_id} \
  -H "public-api-key: $YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  -H "private-secret-key: $YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

The response includes masked details (last 4 digits for cards), the vaulted token ID, and card metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "2fd6bf11-2129-4061-9c2a-34e196f89753",
  "name": "VISA ****1111",
  "type": "CARD",
  "category": "CARD",
  "country": "US",
  "status": "ENROLLED",
  "vaulted_token": "7ced7717-f860-4705-a376-58a714953de9",
  "card_data": {
    "iin": "41111111",
    "lfd": "1111",
    "brand": "VISA",
    "category": "CREDIT",
    "fingerprint": "55a7fe38-cdc3-45dc-8c5f-820751799c76"
  }
}
```

## Checking Available Methods

When you create a checkout session, Yuno determines available payment methods based on the country, currency, and your merchant configuration. The SDK uses this to display payment options to the customer.

<Note>
If a payment method you expect is missing, verify it is enabled in **Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods** for the target country. Also confirm you have a provider configured for that method in your routing rules.
