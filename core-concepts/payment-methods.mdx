## Payment-Method-Specific Requirements

Different payment methods require different fields in the payment request.

### Cards

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card": {
      "number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiration_month": "12",
      "expiration_year": "2028",
      "security_code": "123",
      "holder_name": "MARIA SILVA"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Sending raw card data via the API requires PCI DSS compliance. Use the Yuno SDK with tokenization to avoid PCI scope.
</Warning>

### PIX (Brazil)

```json
{
  "payment_method": { "type": "PIX" },
  "country": "BR",
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00 },
  "customer": {
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  PIX requires `customer.document` with a valid CPF (individuals) or CNPJ (businesses). The response includes a QR code and a copy-paste code for the customer.
</Note>

### Boleto (Brazil)

```json
{
  "payment_method": { "type": "BOLETO" },
  "country": "BR",
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 200.00 },
  "customer": {
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    },
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }
}
```

Boleto payments are asynchronous -- the customer receives a bank slip and pays at a bank branch or online banking. Use [webhooks](/core-concepts/webhooks) to receive the payment confirmation.

## Enrolling (Vaulting) Payment Methods

To save a payment method for future use, include `"vaulted_token": true` in the payment request along with a `customer_id`. See [Tokens](/core-concepts/tokens) for details.

## Listing Enrolled Methods

Retrieve all saved payment methods for a customer:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```

The response includes masked details (last 4 digits for cards, masked keys for PIX) and the vaulted token ID for use in one-click payments.

## Checking Available Methods

The checkout session response includes `available_payment_methods`, which lists methods available for the given country, currency, and merchant configuration:

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "cs_abc123",
  "available_payment_methods": ["CARD", "PIX", "BOLETO"]
}
```

<Note>
  If a payment method you expect is missing from this list, verify it is enabled in **Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods** for the target country.
