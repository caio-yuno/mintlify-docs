## Overview

A payment represents a charge against a customer's selected payment method. Payments are always created within the context of a [checkout session](/core-concepts/checkout-sessions) and are processed through the provider determined by your [routing configuration](/core-concepts/providers).

## Creating a Payment

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "checkout_session": "cs_abc123def456",
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "PIX"
    },
    "amount": {
      "currency": "BRL",
      "value": 100.00
    },
    "country": "BR",
    "customer": {
      "document": {
        "document_type": "CPF",
        "document_number": "12345678901"
      },
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Payment Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Next Actions |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `PENDING` | Awaiting customer action or provider confirmation | Wait for webhook update |
| `AUTHORIZED` | Funds reserved (auth-only mode) | Capture or cancel |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Funds captured successfully | Refund if needed |
| `DECLINED` | Provider/issuer declined the charge | Retry with different method or provider |
| `REJECTED` | Yuno validation or fraud rules blocked the payment | Fix request and retry |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled before completion | Create new payment |
| `REFUNDED` | Captured funds returned to customer | No further action |

## Auto-Capture vs Manual Capture

By default, payments are auto-captured. Set `"capture": false` to use manual capture (auth-only).

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "cs_abc123def456",
  "capture": false,
  "payment_method": { "type": "CARD" },
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 200.00 },
  "country": "BR"
}
```

### Capturing an Authorized Payment

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/capture \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```

<Warning>
  Capture authorized payments within the provider's hold period (typically 5-7 days for cards). Uncaptured authorizations are voided automatically.
</Warning>

## Refunds

Refund a succeeded payment partially or fully:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/refunds \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 50.00,
    "reason": "Customer requested partial refund"
  }'
```

<Note>
  Refund availability depends on the payment method and provider. Some methods (e.g., Boleto, OXXO) may not support refunds through the API.
</Note>

## Cancellations

Cancel a payment that has not yet been captured:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/cancel \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```
