## What is a Provider?

A provider in Yuno is a payment processor, acquirer, or gateway that executes transactions. Yuno abstracts the complexity of individual provider APIs behind a unified interface, so you integrate once and route to any connected provider.

Examples include Stripe, Adyen, Mercado Pago, dLocal, PagSeguro, and dozens of regional acquirers across Latin America and globally.

## Multi-Provider Architecture

```
                    +-----------+
                    |  Yuno API |
                    +-----+-----+
                          |
           +--------------+--------------+
           |              |              |
     +-----+-----+  +----+-----+  +-----+------+
     | Provider A |  | Provider B|  | Provider C |
     | (Primary)  |  | (Fallback)|  | (Regional) |
     +-----------+  +----------+  +------------+
```

You can connect multiple providers for the same payment method and country. Yuno selects the optimal provider for each transaction based on your routing rules.

## Smart Routing

Smart routing determines which provider processes each transaction. Configure routing rules in **Dashboard > Routing**.

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Priority-based** | Route to providers in a fixed order | Simple setups, single-provider preference |
| **Cost optimization** | Route to the provider with lowest fees | Reducing processing costs |
| **Approval rate** | Route based on historical success rates | Maximizing conversion |
| **Geographic** | Route to local acquirers for domestic transactions | Improving approval rates in specific regions |
| **Custom rules** | Route based on BIN, amount, payment method, or metadata | Advanced orchestration |

<Note>
Smart routing decisions are made per-transaction, not per-payment. If a payment cascades to a second provider, the routing engine evaluates the best option for the retry independently.
</Note>

## Failover and Cascading

When a provider declines or fails to respond, Yuno can automatically retry with the next provider in your routing configuration. This creates multiple [transactions](/core-concepts/transactions) under the same payment:

```
Payment:
  Transaction 1: Provider A  -->  DECLINED (insufficient funds)
  Transaction 2: Provider B  -->  SUCCEEDED
  Final Status: SUCCEEDED
```

Configure cascading behavior in **Dashboard > Routing**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Max retries** | Maximum number of providers to try (e.g., 3) |
| **Retry on** | Which decline codes trigger a retry (e.g., timeout, generic decline) |
| **Exclude on** | Which decline codes should NOT retry (e.g., fraud, lost card) |

<Warning>
Not all declines should trigger a cascade. Hard declines (stolen card, fraud) should not be retried with another provider. Configure your exclude rules to prevent unnecessary retries.
</Warning>

## Provider Configuration

Set up providers in **Dashboard > Providers**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a provider">
    Navigate to **Dashboard > Providers > Add Provider** and select from the available integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter credentials">
    Provide the provider's API keys, merchant IDs, and any required configuration. Each provider has different credential requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable payment methods">
    Select which payment methods this provider should handle (cards, PIX, Boleto, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure routing">
    Go to **Dashboard > Routing** to set priority, failover rules, and any conditional routing logic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Provider Response Mapping

Yuno normalizes provider responses into a standard format. The raw provider response is preserved in the [transaction](/core-concepts/transactions) `provider_data` field for debugging:

| Yuno Status | Typical Provider Meaning |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| `SUCCEEDED` | Approved, authorized |
| `DECLINED` | Insufficient funds, do not honor, restricted card |
| `REJECTED` | Invalid data, fraud suspicion |
| `FAILED` | Timeout, network error, provider outage |

The `provider_data` object includes:

```json
{
  "provider_data": {
    "id": "STRIPE",
    "transaction_id": "pi_3abc123",
    "status": "SUCCEEDED",
    "status_detail": "SUCCEEDED",
    "response_code": "SUCCEEDED",
    "response_message": null,
    "iso8583_response_code": "00",
    "iso8583_response_message": "Approved or completed successfully"
  }
}
```
