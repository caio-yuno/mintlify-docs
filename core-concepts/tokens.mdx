## What is Tokenization?

Tokenization replaces sensitive payment data (card numbers, bank account details) with a non-sensitive token. This token can be used in API calls without exposing the original data, reducing your PCI scope and enabling features like one-click checkout.

## Token Types

Yuno supports three token types, each suited for different use cases.

### One-Time Tokens

A one-time token represents a single payment method submission. It is generated by the Yuno SDK when the customer enters their payment details and is valid for one payment only.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Created by** | Yuno SDK (client-side) |
| **Validity** | Single use, expires after payment or timeout |
| **PCI scope** | None (SDK handles sensitive data) |
| **Use case** | Standard checkout, guest payments |

```javascript
// SDK generates a one-time token after customer input
yuno.mountCheckout({
  checkoutSession: 'cs_abc123',
  onTokenize: (token) => {
    // Send token.one_time_token to your server
    createPayment(token.one_time_token);
  }
});
```

### Vaulted Tokens

A vaulted token stores a payment method for future use, associated with a [customer profile](/core-concepts/customers). Use vaulted tokens for returning customers and one-click checkout.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Created by** | Yuno API (when `vaulted_token: true` in payment) |
| **Validity** | Persistent until deleted or expired |
| **PCI scope** | None (Yuno stores sensitive data) |
| **Use case** | Returning customers, one-click checkout, subscriptions |

To vault a payment method during a payment:

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "cs_abc123",
  "payment_method": { "type": "CARD" },
  "customer": { "customer_id": "cust_456" },
  "vaulted_token": true
}
```

<Note>
  The customer must have a Yuno customer profile before you can vault a token. Create one via `POST /v1/customers` if needed.
</Note>

### SDK Tokens

SDK tokens are session-scoped tokens used internally by the Yuno SDK to maintain state between initialization and payment creation. You typically do not interact with SDK tokens directly.

## When to Use Each Token

| Scenario | Token Type | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Guest checkout | One-time | No customer relationship needed |
| Returning customer | Vaulted | Skip payment input, one-click pay |
| Subscription billing | Vaulted | Charge recurring without customer presence |
| SDK-based checkout | One-time + SDK | SDK manages both internally |
| Server-to-server (PCI) | None (raw data) | Direct API with PCI compliance |

<Warning>
  Vaulted tokens are tied to a specific customer and cannot be transferred between customers. If a customer wants to use a different card, create a new vaulted token.
</Warning>

## Retrieving Vaulted Tokens

List all vaulted payment methods for a customer:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```

## Deleting a Vaulted Token

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods/{token_id} \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```
