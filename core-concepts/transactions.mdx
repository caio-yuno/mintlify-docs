## Payments vs Transactions

A **payment** represents the merchant's intent to collect funds. A **transaction** represents a single processing attempt against a provider. One payment can have multiple transactions when Yuno retries or cascades across providers.

```
Payment (1)  ──>  Transaction 1: Provider A (DECLINED)
             ──>  Transaction 2: Provider B (SUCCEEDED)  <-- final result
```

## Why Multiple Transactions?

Yuno creates additional transactions in these scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Provider decline** | Primary provider declines; Yuno retries with a fallback provider |
| **Provider timeout** | Primary provider does not respond within the configured window |
| **Cascading rules** | Your routing configuration specifies retry behavior across providers |
| **Capture** | A separate transaction records the capture of an authorized payment |
| **Refund** | Each refund (full or partial) creates its own transaction |

## Transaction Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AUTHORIZATION` | Reserves funds on the customer's payment instrument |
| `CAPTURE` | Transfers previously authorized funds to the merchant |
| `SALE` | Combined authorization and capture in a single step (auto-capture) |
| `REFUND` | Returns captured funds to the customer |
| `VOID` | Releases an authorization without capturing funds |
| `CANCELLATION` | Cancels a pending or authorized payment |

## Transaction Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `PENDING` | Transaction submitted, awaiting provider response |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Provider confirmed successful processing |
| `DECLINED` | Provider or issuer declined the transaction |
| `REJECTED` | Transaction blocked by validation or fraud rules |
| `FAILED` | Processing error (network issue, provider error) |
| `CANCELLED` | Transaction cancelled before completion |

## Viewing Transactions

Retrieve all transactions for a payment:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/transactions \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code"
```

Each transaction includes the provider used, the provider's raw response code, and timing information:

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "transaction_id": "txn_001",
      "type": "SALE",
      "status": "DECLINED",
      "provider": "provider_a",
      "provider_response_code": "51",
      "provider_response_message": "Insufficient funds",
      "created_at": "2026-02-28T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "transaction_id": "txn_002",
      "type": "SALE",
      "status": "SUCCEEDED",
      "provider": "provider_b",
      "provider_response_code": "00",
      "provider_response_message": "Approved",
      "created_at": "2026-02-28T10:00:02Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The `provider_response_code` and `provider_response_message` contain the raw response from the acquirer or issuer. These are useful for debugging declines but vary across providers.
</Note>

## Transaction vs Payment Status

The payment status reflects the **final outcome** across all transactions. If the first transaction is declined but a cascade succeeds, the payment status is `SUCCEEDED` even though one transaction was `DECLINED`.

<Warning>
  Always use the **payment status** for business logic (order fulfillment, notifications to customers). Use transaction-level data only for debugging and analytics.
</Warning>
