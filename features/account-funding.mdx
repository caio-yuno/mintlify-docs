## Overview

Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) are a specific transaction type used to transfer funds from a payment card to a non-card account, such as a digital wallet, prepaid card, or money transfer service. AFTs have distinct processing rules and compliance requirements compared to standard purchase transactions.

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Wallet loading | Customer funds a digital wallet from a debit or credit card |
| Prepaid card funding | Loading funds onto a prepaid card |
| Money transfer | Person-to-person transfers via card-funded services |
| Account top-up | Adding funds to a stored-value account |

## API Parameters

To create an Account Funding Transaction, set the `transaction_type` field to `ACCOUNT_FUNDING`:

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "session-id",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "token": "one-time-token"
  },
  "amount": { "currency": "USD", "value": 100.00 },
  "country": "US",
  "transaction_type": "ACCOUNT_FUNDING",
  "customer": {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "description": "Wallet top-up"
}
```

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `transaction_type` | `ACCOUNT_FUNDING` | Identifies this as an AFT |

<Note>
All other payment fields (amount, customer, payment_method) follow the same schema as standard card payments. See [Card Payments](/guides/payment-methods/cards) for details.
</Note>

## Card Network Requirements

Card networks classify AFTs differently from standard purchases:

### Visa

- AFTs use the Original Credit Transaction (OCT) framework
- Visa requires the merchant to register for AFT processing
- Transaction limits may apply based on merchant category and risk profile

### Mastercard

- AFTs are classified under the Payment Transaction category
- Mastercard requires specific MCC (Merchant Category Code) registration
- Enhanced due diligence may be required for high-value transfers

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

AFTs are subject to additional regulatory requirements due to their money-movement nature:

1. **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Verify the identity of both sender and recipient where applicable
2. **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Monitor AFT patterns for suspicious activity
3. **Transaction limits**: Card networks and regulators impose limits on AFT amounts and frequency
4. **Cross-border restrictions**: Some jurisdictions restrict cross-border AFTs; verify country-specific rules
5. **Reporting**: Maintain records of AFTs for regulatory reporting requirements

<Warning>
AFT compliance requirements vary significantly by jurisdiction. Consult with your compliance team and Yuno account manager before implementing AFTs to ensure you meet all applicable regulations.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 400: `invalid transaction_type` | Typo or unsupported value | Use exactly `ACCOUNT_FUNDING` |
| 403: `AFT not enabled` | Merchant not registered for AFTs | Contact Yuno support to enable AFT processing |
| Decline: `transaction not permitted` | Card issuer blocks AFTs on the card | Customer should contact their issuer or use a different card |
