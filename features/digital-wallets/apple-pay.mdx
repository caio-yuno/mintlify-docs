## Overview

Apple Pay enables customers to pay using cards stored in their Apple Wallet. Transactions are authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode, providing a seamless and secure checkout experience. Through Yuno, you can accept Apple Pay on Safari (web), iOS apps, and in-app contexts.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Apple Pay, ensure you have completed the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SSL Certificate">
    Your domain must serve content over HTTPS with a valid SSL/TLS certificate. Apple Pay will not function on HTTP or self-signed certificates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain Verification">
    Register and verify your payment domain with Apple through the Yuno Dashboard. Navigate to **Settings > Digital Wallets > Apple Pay** and add your domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apple Developer Account">
    You need an Apple Developer account to create a Merchant ID and configure payment processing certificates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuno Configuration">
    Enable Apple Pay in your Yuno Dashboard and upload the required Apple merchant certificates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Domain verification is mandatory. Apple Pay buttons will not render on unverified domains. The verification file must be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.
</Warning>

## Integration with Full Checkout SDK

When using Yuno's Full Checkout SDK, the Apple Pay button renders automatically on supported devices.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "BR",
  currency: "BRL",
  amount: "150.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_abc123",
  // Apple Pay button appears automatically on Safari/iOS
});

checkout.mount("#checkout-container");
```

## Direct API Integration

For Direct API integrations, you handle the Apple Pay session and pass the payment token to Yuno.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Web (Safari)
// 1. Create an Apple Pay session
const session = new ApplePaySession(3, {
  countryCode: "BR",
  currencyCode: "BRL",
  supportedNetworks: ["visa", "masterCard"],
  merchantCapabilities: ["supports3DS"],
  total: {
    label: "Your Store",
    amount: "150.00"
  }
});

// 2. Handle payment authorization
session.onpaymentauthorized = async (event) => {
  const applePayToken = event.payment.token;

  // 3. Send token to Yuno
  const response = await fetch("/api/pay", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      payment_method: {
        type: "APPLE_PAY",
        token: applePayToken.paymentData
      }
    })
  });
};

session.begin();
```
</CodeGroup>

</Info>

## Testing in Sandbox

1. Use an Apple sandbox tester account (created in App Store Connect).
2. Add test cards to the Apple Wallet on a physical device or simulator.
3. Process test transactions using your Yuno sandbox credentials.

<Note>
  Apple Pay cannot be tested in desktop browsers without a paired iPhone or Apple Watch. Use the iOS Simulator in Xcode or a physical Apple device for testing.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Button not rendering | Unverified domain | Complete domain verification in Dashboard |
| "Payment not completed" | Expired certificate | Renew Apple merchant certificate |
| Session timeout | Network latency | Ensure server-to-Apple communication is under 30 seconds |
| Unsupported device | Non-Apple device | Apple Pay only works on Apple devices with Safari |
