## Overview

Click to Pay is a card network-backed checkout experience developed by Visa and Mastercard (under the EMVCo SRC standard). It enables returning cardholders to complete purchases with a single click, without re-entering card details. Unlike Apple Pay or Google Pay, Click to Pay does not require a specific device or app -- it works across all browsers and devices.

## How It Works

1. The customer enters their email address at checkout.
2. Click to Pay recognizes the email and retrieves enrolled card profiles.
3. The customer selects a stored card and confirms with a one-time passcode (OTP).
4. A payment token is generated and passed to Yuno for processing.
5. No card numbers are transmitted -- only tokenized credentials.

<Info>
  Click to Pay works for cardholders who have previously enrolled their cards with Visa or Mastercard's Click to Pay service, either directly or through their issuing bank.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Click to Pay">
    Activate Click to Pay in your Yuno Dashboard under **Settings > Digital Wallets > Click to Pay**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supported Networks">
    Ensure your payment provider supports Visa and/or Mastercard tokenized transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="HTTPS Required">
    Your checkout page must be served over HTTPS.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with Full Checkout SDK

When enabled, the Full Checkout SDK automatically detects returning Click to Pay users and presents the streamlined flow.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "US",
  currency: "USD",
  amount: "75.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_ctp456",
  customer: {
    email: "customer@example.com" // Used for Click to Pay recognition
  }
});

checkout.mount("#checkout-container");
```

## Direct API Integration

For Direct API, you interact with the Click to Pay (SRC) system to obtain a token, then pass it to Yuno.

```json
POST /v1/payments
{
  "amount": {
    "value": 75.00,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "country": "US",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CLICK_TO_PAY",
    "token": "src_token_from_click_to_pay"
  },
  "customer": {
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Customer Enrollment

Customers can enroll in Click to Pay through:

- Their issuing bank's app or website
- The Visa or Mastercard Click to Pay portals
- During checkout on a merchant site that supports enrollment

<Warning>
  Click to Pay recognition is email-based. Customers must use the same email they enrolled with. If the email does not match, the standard card entry form is presented as a fallback.
