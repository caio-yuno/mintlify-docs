## Overview

Google Pay allows customers to pay using cards stored in their Google account. With billions of Google accounts worldwide, Google Pay provides a massive reach for one-tap checkout experiences. Through Yuno, you can accept Google Pay on Chrome (web), Android apps, and other supported browsers.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Google Merchant Account">
    Register for a Google Pay merchant account through the [Google Pay Business Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console). Obtain your Google Merchant ID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="HTTPS Required">
    Your checkout page must be served over HTTPS. Google Pay will not load on insecure pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuno Configuration">
    Enable Google Pay in your Yuno Dashboard under **Settings > Digital Wallets > Google Pay**. Enter your Google Merchant ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with Full Checkout SDK

Yuno's Full Checkout SDK automatically renders the Google Pay button when the customer's browser supports it.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "MX",
  currency: "MXN",
  amount: "500.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_xyz789",
  // Google Pay button appears automatically on supported browsers
});

checkout.mount("#checkout-container");
```

## Direct API Integration

For Direct API integrations, use the Google Pay JavaScript library to obtain a payment token, then pass it to Yuno.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Web
// 1. Initialize Google Pay client
const paymentsClient = new google.payments.api.PaymentsClient({
  environment: "TEST" // Use "PRODUCTION" for live
});

// 2. Define payment request
const paymentDataRequest = {
  apiVersion: 2,
  apiVersionMinor: 0,
  allowedPaymentMethods: [{
    type: "CARD",
    parameters: {
      allowedAuthMethods: ["PAN_ONLY", "CRYPTOGRAM_3DS"],
      allowedCardNetworks: ["VISA", "MASTERCARD"]
    },
    tokenizationSpecification: {
      type: "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
      parameters: {
        gateway: "yuno",
        gatewayMerchantId: "YOUR_YUNO_MERCHANT_ID"
      }
    }
  }],
  transactionInfo: {
    totalPriceStatus: "FINAL",
    totalPrice: "500.00",
    currencyCode: "MXN",
    countryCode: "MX"
  }
};

// 3. Request payment data
const paymentData = await paymentsClient.loadPaymentData(paymentDataRequest);
const googlePayToken = paymentData.paymentMethodData.tokenizationData.token;

// 4. Send token to Yuno via your backend
await submitPayment({ type: "GOOGLE_PAY", token: googlePayToken });
```

</Info>

## Testing in Sandbox

1. Use `environment: "TEST"` in the Google Pay client initialization.
2. Google provides test card numbers that work in the TEST environment.
3. Pair with your Yuno sandbox credentials for end-to-end testing.

<Note>
  In TEST mode, Google Pay returns a test token that will not process real charges. Switch to `"PRODUCTION"` and your live Yuno keys before going live.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Button not showing | Browser not supported | Google Pay requires Chrome 61+ or compatible browser |
| `DEVELOPER_ERROR` | Invalid merchant ID | Verify Google Merchant ID in Dashboard settings |
| Token rejected | Wrong environment | Ensure Google Pay and Yuno environments match (test/prod) |
| No cards available | User has no cards | Customer must add cards to their Google account |
