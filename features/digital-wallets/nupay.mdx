## Overview

NuPay is Nubank's digital wallet payment method that allows Brazilian customers to pay directly from their Nubank account balance or credit line. With over 90 million customers in Brazil, Nubank represents a significant payment channel for merchants targeting the Brazilian market.

Through Yuno, you can integrate NuPay alongside other payment methods, offering Nubank customers a familiar and fast checkout experience.

## How It Works

1. The customer selects NuPay at checkout.
2. They are redirected to the Nubank app for authentication.
3. The customer confirms the payment using their Nubank app PIN or biometrics.
4. Nubank processes the payment from the customer's balance or credit line.
5. The merchant receives confirmation via webhook once the payment is completed.

<Info>
  NuPay transactions are confirmed in real-time after the customer approves in the Nubank app. Settlement follows Nubank's standard schedule.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with Full Checkout SDK

The Full Checkout SDK automatically displays the NuPay option for Brazilian transactions when enabled.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "BR",
  currency: "BRL",
  amount: "200.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_nupay789",
  customer: {
    email: "customer@example.com",
    document: {
      document_type: "CPF",
      document_number: "12345678901"
    }
  }
});

checkout.mount("#checkout-container");
```

## Direct API Integration

```json
POST /v1/payments
{
  "amount": {
    "value": 200.00,
    "currency": "BRL"
  },
  "country": "BR",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "NUPAY"
  },
  "customer": {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "document": {
      "document_type": "CPF",
      "document_number": "12345678901"
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes a redirect URL to the Nubank app:

```json
{
  "id": "pay_nupay_abc123",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "redirect_url": "https://nupay.nubank.com.br/checkout/abc123",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "NUPAY"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  The `customer.document` field with a valid CPF is mandatory for NuPay transactions. CNPJ is not supported for NuPay.
</Warning>

| 4 | Return to merchant | Redirect back |

## Supported Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Country | BR (Brazil only) |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| NuPay not showing | Not enabled for BR | Enable in Dashboard > Payment Methods > Brazil |
| Redirect fails | Customer not a Nubank user | NuPay requires an active Nubank account |
| Payment timeout | Customer did not confirm | Set appropriate timeout and handle expiration gracefully |
| Missing CPF error | `customer.document` not provided | Include CPF in request body |
