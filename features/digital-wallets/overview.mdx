## Overview

Digital wallets provide a streamlined checkout experience by allowing customers to pay using stored payment credentials. Through Yuno, you can integrate multiple digital wallet options with a single API, reducing checkout friction and increasing conversion rates.

Digital wallets offer several advantages over traditional card entry:

- **Faster checkout**: Customers authenticate with biometrics or device PIN instead of typing card details.
- **Higher security**: Wallets use tokenized credentials, reducing PCI scope and fraud risk.
- **Better conversion**: Fewer form fields and faster completion lead to lower cart abandonment.
- **Cross-device support**: Wallets work across web, mobile, and in-app contexts.

## Integration Approaches

### Full Checkout SDK

The simplest integration path. Yuno's Full Checkout SDK automatically renders available digital wallet buttons based on the customer's device and browser capabilities.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "BR",
  currency: "BRL",
  amount: "100.00",
  // Digital wallet buttons render automatically
});
```

### Lite Checkout SDK

Use the Lite Checkout for more control over the UI while still leveraging Yuno's wallet integrations. You handle the button placement and styling.

### Direct API

For full control, integrate each wallet directly via Yuno's Payments API. This approach requires handling wallet-specific authentication flows and token management.

<Note>
  When using the Full or Lite Checkout SDK, wallet availability is automatically detected based on the customer's device. For Direct API integrations, you must implement device detection logic yourself.
</Note>

## Security Benefits

All digital wallet transactions use tokenized card credentials, meaning the actual card number is never transmitted. This provides:

- **Reduced PCI scope**: No raw card data touches your servers.
- **Dynamic cryptograms**: Each transaction uses a unique cryptogram, preventing replay attacks.
- **Biometric authentication**: Device-level verification adds a strong authentication layer.
