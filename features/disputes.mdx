## Overview

Disputes occur when a cardholder contests a transaction with their issuing bank. Yuno provides a unified Disputes API to track, respond to, and manage chargebacks across all your payment providers. Timely and well-documented responses are critical to winning disputes and protecting your revenue.

## Dispute Lifecycle

| Status | Description | Merchant Action |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `OPEN` | Dispute filed by cardholder | Review and prepare evidence |
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | Evidence submitted, awaiting decision | Monitor for updates |
| `WON` | Dispute resolved in merchant's favor | Funds returned to merchant |
| `LOST` | Dispute resolved in cardholder's favor | Funds debited from merchant |
| `EXPIRED` | Response deadline passed without action | Automatic loss, funds debited |

<Warning>
  Each dispute has a strict response deadline (typically 7-30 days depending on the card network). Failing to respond before the deadline results in an automatic loss.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Provide as much relevant evidence as possible in a single submission. Multiple submissions may not be allowed depending on the card network's dispute process.

## Webhook Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `dispute.created` | New dispute filed |
| `dispute.updated` | Dispute status changed |
| `dispute.won` | Resolved in merchant's favor |
| `dispute.lost` | Resolved in cardholder's favor |
| `dispute.deadline_approaching` | Response deadline within 48 hours |

## Best Practices

- **Respond promptly**: Submit evidence well before the deadline. Do not wait until the last day.
- **Use 3D Secure**: Transactions authenticated with 3DS benefit from liability shift, which can resolve disputes in your favor automatically.
- **Keep records**: Maintain delivery confirmations, customer communications, and transaction logs.
- **Monitor `dispute.created` webhooks**: Set up alerts for immediate notification of new disputes.
- **Track dispute rates**: A dispute rate above 1% can trigger card network monitoring programs.

<Note>
  You can also manage disputes through the Yuno Dashboard under **Payments > Disputes**, which provides a visual interface for reviewing dispute details and uploading evidence.
