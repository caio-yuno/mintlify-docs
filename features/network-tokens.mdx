## Overview

Network Tokens replace raw card numbers (PANs) with network-issued tokens provided by Visa and Mastercard. These tokens are automatically updated when a card is renewed, reissued, or replaced, ensuring that recurring and stored-credential transactions continue to process without customer intervention. Network tokenization typically improves authorization rates by 2-5% and reduces fraud-related declines.

## How Network Tokens Work

1. When a customer saves their card through Yuno, a network token request is sent to Visa or Mastercard.
2. The card network issues a unique token that maps to the customer's PAN.
3. Subsequent transactions use the network token instead of the raw PAN.
4. If the card is renewed or reissued, the network automatically updates the token mapping.
5. Each transaction generates a unique cryptogram, preventing replay attacks.

## Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Higher approval rates** | Issuers trust network tokens more than raw PANs (+2-5% approval lift) |
| **Automatic card updates** | Token stays valid when card is renewed or replaced |
| **Reduced fraud** | Dynamic cryptograms prevent card-not-present fraud |
| **Lower interchange** | Some networks offer reduced interchange for tokenized transactions |
| **Improved compliance** | Tokens reduce PCI scope since raw PANs are not stored |

<Info>
  Network tokens are distinct from Yuno vault tokens. A Yuno vault token references a stored card in Yuno's PCI-compliant vault. A network token is issued by Visa/Mastercard and is used at the acquirer/issuer level for transaction processing.
</Info>

## Enabling Network Tokens

Network tokenization is enabled at the merchant account level. Contact Yuno support or enable it in your Dashboard under **Settings > Card Processing > Network Tokens**.

### Supported Networks

| Network | Token Service | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Visa | Visa Token Service (VTS) | Supported |
| Mastercard | Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) | Supported |

## Integration

Network tokenization is transparent to your integration. Once enabled, Yuno automatically provisions network tokens for eligible cards and uses them for transactions.

### Automatic Provisioning

When a customer stores a card:

```json
POST /v1/customers/{customer_id}/payment-methods
{
  "type": "CARD",
  "vaulted_token": "tok_card_abc123",
  "country": "BR"
}
```

Yuno automatically requests a network token from the card network. No additional API calls are needed.

### Token Lifecycle Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `network_token.provisioned` | Network token created for a stored card |
| `network_token.updated` | Token mapping updated (card renewal) |
| `network_token.suspended` | Token temporarily suspended by issuer |
| `network_token.deactivated` | Token permanently deactivated |

## Impact on Authorization

```
Without Network Tokens:
  PAN 4242...4242 ──> Acquirer ──> Issuer ──> Approve/Decline

With Network Tokens:
  Token + Cryptogram ──> Acquirer ──> Network ──> Issuer ──> Approve/Decline
                                        │
                                   Token mapped
                                   to current PAN
```

<Warning>
  Not all cards are eligible for network tokenization. Eligibility depends on the issuing bank's participation in the token service. Ineligible cards continue to process normally using the vaulted PAN.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Enable for all stored cards**: Network tokens benefit any transaction using stored credentials.
- **Monitor approval rate changes**: Track the impact of network tokenization on your authorization rates in the Dashboard.
- **Use with recurring payments**: Network tokens are particularly valuable for subscriptions where cards may expire between billing cycles.
- **Combine with 3D Secure**: Network tokens and 3DS together provide the highest approval rates and strongest fraud protection.

<Note>
  Network token provisioning is asynchronous. The first transaction after card storage may use the raw PAN while the network token is being provisioned. Subsequent transactions will use the network token.
