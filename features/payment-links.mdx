## Overview

Payment Links allow you to create shareable URLs that direct customers to a hosted payment page. This is ideal for scenarios where you need to collect payments without building or maintaining a checkout frontend -- such as invoice payments, social commerce, email campaigns, or phone orders.

Each payment link generates a unique URL that can be shared via email, SMS, messaging apps, or embedded in a website.

## Creating a Payment Link

Use the Payment Links API to generate a shareable payment URL.

    },
    "country": "BR",
    "description": "Invoice #1042 - Premium Plan",

## Payment Link Lifecycle

| `COMPLETED` | Payment has been successfully collected |
| `EXPIRED` | Link passed its expiration date |

</Info>

## Managing Payment Links

### List Payment Links

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.y.uno/v1/payment-links \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'X-Account-Code: YOUR_ACCOUNT_CODE'
```

### Cancel a Payment Link

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.y.uno/v1/payment-links/pl_abc123def456/cancel \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'X-Account-Code: YOUR_ACCOUNT_CODE'
```

## Webhook Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `payment_link.created` | New payment link generated |
| `payment_link.paid` | Customer completed payment |
| `payment_link.expired` | Link reached expiration date |
| `payment_link.cancelled` | Link was manually cancelled |

<Warning>
  Always set an `expiration_date` for payment links to prevent stale links from being used unexpectedly. A common practice is 7-30 days depending on the use case.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

- **Invoice payments**: Send payment links in invoices for easy collection.
- **Social commerce**: Share links on social media or messaging apps.
- **Phone orders**: Generate links during phone calls for customers to pay.
- **Email campaigns**: Embed payment links in marketing emails.
- **Donations**: Create one-time donation collection links.

<Note>
  Payment links use Yuno's hosted checkout page, which is fully PCI-compliant and handles all payment method rendering and processing. No frontend development is required on your side.
