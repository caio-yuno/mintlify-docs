## Overview

Yuno Payouts enable you to send money from your merchant account to recipients' bank accounts, digital wallets, or cards. This is essential for marketplaces paying sellers, platforms disbursing earnings, insurance companies processing claims, or any business that needs to move funds outward.

## Payout Flow

1. **Create a recipient** with their banking or wallet details.
2. **Initiate a payout** specifying the amount, currency, and recipient.
3. **Yuno routes the payout** through the appropriate provider for the destination.
4. **Track the status** via webhooks or the Payouts API.

## Creating a Recipient

Before sending a payout, register the recipient's financial details.
