## Overview

Split Payments allow you to divide a single customer payment across multiple recipients in a single transaction. This is essential for marketplaces, platforms, and any business model where a payment needs to be distributed among sellers, service providers, or partners -- with the platform optionally retaining a commission.

## How Split Payments Work

1. A customer makes a single payment on your platform.
2. You specify the split rules: how the payment amount is distributed among recipients.
3. Yuno processes the payment and routes funds to each recipient according to the split configuration.
4. The platform can retain a commission or fee from each split.

## Split Payment Example

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.y.uno/v1/payments \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'X-Account-Code: YOUR_ACCOUNT_CODE' \
  --data '{
    "amount": {
      "value": 200.00,
      "currency": "BRL"
    },
    "country": "BR",
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "CARD",
      "token": "tok_card_abc123"
    },
    "split": [
      {
        "recipient_id": "rec_seller_001",
        "amount": 160.00,
        "description": "Seller payment"
      },
      {
        "recipient_id": "rec_platform",
        "amount": 40.00,
        "description": "Platform commission"
      }
    ],
    "customer": {
      "email": "buyer@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

```json Response
{
  "id": "pay_split_abc123",
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "amount": {
    "value": 200.00,
    "currency": "BRL"
  },
  "split": [
    {
      "recipient_id": "rec_seller_001",
      "amount": 160.00,
      "status": "PENDING_SETTLEMENT"
    },
    {
      "recipient_id": "rec_platform",
      "amount": 40.00,
      "status": "PENDING_SETTLEMENT"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Split Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Fixed amount** | Each recipient gets a specific amount | Seller: $160, Platform: $40 |
| **Percentage** | Each recipient gets a percentage of total | Seller: 80%, Platform: 20% |
| **Remainder** | One recipient gets the remainder after others | Seller: remainder, Platform: $40 |

## Marketplace Architecture

```
Customer Payment ($200)
    │
    ├── Seller A ──── $120 (product cost)
    ├── Seller B ──── $50  (product cost)
    └── Platform ──── $30  (commission)
```

<Warning>
  The sum of all split amounts must equal the total payment amount. If the amounts do not match, the API will return a validation error.
</Warning>

## Managing Recipients

Register each seller or partner as a payout recipient before using them in splits.

```json
POST /v1/payout-recipients
{
  "name": "Seller Store ABC",
  "email": "seller@storeABC.com",
  "document": {
    "document_type": "CNPJ",
    "document_number": "12345678000190"
  },
  "bank_account": {
    "bank_code": "341",
    "branch": "0001",
    "account_number": "12345-6",
    "account_type": "CHECKING"
  },
  "country": "BR"
}
```

## Refunds on Split Payments

When refunding a split payment, you can refund the full amount or specify per-recipient refund amounts.

```json
POST /v1/payments/pay_split_abc123/refund
{
  "amount": 200.00,
  "split_refund": [
    { "recipient_id": "rec_seller_001", "amount": 160.00 },
    { "recipient_id": "rec_platform", "amount": 40.00 }
  ]
}
```

<Info>
  Partial refunds are supported. You can refund a portion of one recipient's share while leaving others intact.
</Info>

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Split Model |
|----------|-------------|
| **Marketplace** | Seller receives product price, platform takes commission |
| **Food delivery** | Restaurant, driver, and platform each get a share |
| **SaaS with add-ons** | Core platform and add-on providers split revenue |
| **Event tickets** | Venue, promoter, and ticketing platform share proceeds |

## Settlement

Each recipient in a split payment receives their funds according to the settlement schedule configured for their account. Settlement timing may differ per recipient based on their provider and country.

<Note>
  Split payment recipients must be registered and verified before they can receive funds. Verification requirements vary by country and may include document validation and bank account confirmation.
