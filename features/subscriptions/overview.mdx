## Overview

Yuno Subscriptions enable you to set up recurring billing that automatically collects payments from your customers on a defined schedule. Whether you are running a SaaS platform, streaming service, or membership program, subscriptions handle the complexity of recurring payments, including lifecycle management, payment retries, and dunning.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flexible billing cycles** | Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual intervals |
| **Automatic collection** | Payments are charged automatically on schedule |
| **Smart retries** | Failed payments are retried with configurable schedules |
| **Lifecycle management** | Create, pause, resume, cancel, and upgrade subscriptions |
| **Webhooks** | Real-time notifications for payment and subscription events |
| **Multi-currency** | Bill in the customer's local currency |

## How Subscriptions Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enroll Payment Method">
    The customer provides a payment method (card, wallet, etc.) which is securely tokenized and stored for recurring use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Subscription">
    You create a subscription via the API, specifying the billing amount, interval, and start date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Billing">
    Yuno automatically charges the enrolled payment method on each billing cycle.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Outcomes">
    Successful payments advance the subscription. Failed payments trigger smart retries and dunning flows.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Subscription Lifecycle

```
CREATED ──> ACTIVE ──> PAUSED ──> ACTIVE (resumed)
                │                      │
                ├──> PAST_DUE ────────>├──> CANCELLED
                │                      │
                └──> CANCELLED         └──> EXPIRED
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CREATED` | Subscription created but first payment not yet collected |
| `ACTIVE` | Subscription is billing normally |
| `PAST_DUE` | Payment failed, retries in progress |
| `PAUSED` | Billing suspended, can be resumed |
| `CANCELLED` | Subscription terminated (by merchant, customer, or dunning) |
| `EXPIRED` | Subscription reached its end date |

<Info>
  A subscription enters `PAST_DUE` status after a payment failure. Smart retries will attempt to collect the payment according to your retry schedule. If all retries are exhausted, the subscription moves to `CANCELLED` unless you intervene.
</Info>

## Webhook Events

Subscribe to these events for real-time subscription updates:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `subscription.created` | New subscription created |
| `subscription.activated` | First payment collected successfully |
| `subscription.payment.success` | Recurring payment succeeded |
| `subscription.payment.failed` | Recurring payment failed |
| `subscription.past_due` | Subscription entered past due status |
| `subscription.cancelled` | Subscription cancelled |
| `subscription.paused` | Subscription paused |
| `subscription.resumed` | Subscription resumed from pause |

<Warning>
  Always implement webhook handlers for `subscription.payment.failed` and `subscription.past_due` to manage customer communication and access control.
