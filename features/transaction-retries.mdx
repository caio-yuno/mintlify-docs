description: "Configure automatic retry logic for failed payment transactions"

## Overview

Transaction retries allow you to automatically or manually reattempt failed payments. Not all declines are permanent -- soft declines (temporary issues) can often succeed on retry, while hard declines (permanent issues) should not be retried.

Understanding the difference between soft and hard declines and configuring appropriate retry logic can significantly improve your payment success rate.

## Soft Decline vs. Hard Decline

### Soft Declines (Retryable)

Soft declines are temporary failures that may succeed on a subsequent attempt. Common causes include:

- Insufficient funds (customer may add money)
- Issuer temporarily unavailable
- Rate limiting or throttling
- Temporary processing errors
- 3DS authentication timeout

### Hard Declines (Do Not Retry)

Hard declines are permanent failures that will not succeed on retry. Retrying hard declines wastes resources and may trigger penalties:

- Card stolen or lost
- Card expired
- Invalid card number
- Fraud-related decline
- Account closed

<Warning>
Card networks penalize merchants who excessively retry hard declines. Visa and Mastercard monitor retry rates and may impose fines or restrict processing for merchants with high retry-to-decline ratios.
</Warning>

## Retryable Decline Codes

| Code | Description | Retryable | Recommended Action |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Not enough balance | Yes | Retry after 24 hours |
| `ISSUER_UNAVAILABLE` | Issuer system down | Yes | Retry after 1 hour |
| `PROCESSING_ERROR` | Temporary processing issue | Yes | Retry after 15 minutes |
| `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` | 3DS needed but not completed | Yes | Retry with 3DS flow |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Too many attempts | Yes | Retry with exponential backoff |
| `DO_NOT_HONOR` | Generic issuer decline | Maybe | Retry once; if declined again, treat as hard |
| `STOLEN_CARD` | Card reported stolen | No | Do not retry; block card |
| `EXPIRED_CARD` | Card is expired | No | Request updated card from customer |
| `INVALID_CARD` | Card number is invalid | No | Request correct card details |
| `FRAUD_DECLINE` | Suspected fraud | No | Do not retry; review transaction |
| `ACCOUNT_CLOSED` | Cardholder account closed | No | Do not retry; request alternative payment |

## Network Retry Limits

Card networks impose strict limits on retry attempts:

### Visa

| Rule | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Maximum retries | 15 attempts |
| Time window | 30 days from initial decline |
| Applies to | Same card, same merchant |

### Mastercard

| Rule | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Maximum retries (same amount) | 10 attempts within 24 hours |
| Maximum retries (30-day window) | 35 attempts |
| Time window | 30 days from initial decline |
| Applies to | Same card, same amount, same merchant |

<Note>
These limits apply to the combination of card number and merchant. Exceeding these limits may result in network fines. Yuno tracks retry counts automatically when using the retry features.
</Note>

## Cascade Retry vs. Same-Provider Retry

### Same-Provider Retry

Retry the transaction with the same payment provider. Useful when the decline is due to a temporary issue (issuer unavailable, rate limiting).

### Cascade Retry

Route the transaction to a different payment provider. Useful when:
- The provider is experiencing an outage
- The decline is provider-specific
- A different acquirer may have better authorization rates for the card brand or region

Configure cascade routing in **Dashboard > Routing > Cascade Rules** to define fallback providers.

## Configuring Retry Rules

Set up automatic retry rules in the Yuno Dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Retry Rules**
2. Define which decline codes should trigger automatic retries
3. Set the maximum number of retry attempts
4. Configure the delay between retries
5. Optionally enable cascade routing for retries

### Example Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Retryable codes | `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `ISSUER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROCESSING_ERROR` |
| Max retries | 3 |
| Initial delay | 15 minutes |
| Backoff multiplier | 2x |
| Cascade enabled | Yes (fallback to secondary provider) |

## Exponential Backoff

When implementing retry logic, use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming providers and issuers:

```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 15 minutes
Attempt 3: Wait 30 minutes
Attempt 4: Wait 60 minutes
```

For API-level retries (429 rate limit responses), use shorter intervals:

```
Attempt 1: Wait 1 second
Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 3: Wait 4 seconds
Attempt 4: Wait 8 seconds
```

<Note>
Add random jitter (0-1 second) to backoff intervals to avoid thundering herd problems when multiple retries fire simultaneously.
</Note>

## Monitoring Retry Performance

Track retry effectiveness in **Dashboard > Analytics > Retries**:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Retry success rate | Percentage of retries that result in approval |
| Average retries to success | Mean number of attempts before approval |
| Retry-to-decline ratio | Retries vs. total declines (monitor for network compliance) |
| Cascade success rate | Success rate when routing to fallback providers |

<Warning>
If your retry success rate is below 10%, review your retry rules. You may be retrying hard declines unnecessarily, which increases costs and network penalty risk.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Retries always fail | Retrying hard declines | Review decline codes; only retry soft declines |
| Network penalty warning | Exceeding retry limits | Reduce max retries; respect Visa/Mastercard limits |
| Cascade not triggering | No fallback provider configured | Add a secondary provider in **Dashboard > Routing** |
| Duplicate charges | Retry succeeded but original also processed | Use idempotency keys to prevent double-charging |
