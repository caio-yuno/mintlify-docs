## Authentication Headers

All Yuno API requests require three authentication headers:

| Header | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `public-api-key` | Your public API key | Client-side SDK initialization and server-side calls |
| `private-secret-key` | Your private secret key | Server-side API calls only |
| `account-code` | Your account identifier | All API calls |

<Warning>
  Never expose your `private-secret-key` in client-side code, mobile apps, or version control. This key should only be used in server-side environments.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Keys

1. Log in to the [Yuno Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno)
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Copy your sandbox keys for testing, or production keys for live transactions

## Header Format

Include all three headers in every API request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Header Name Aliases

The `account-code` header is the primary and recommended header name. The alias `X-Account-Code` is also accepted by the API and functions identically. Use `account-code` for consistency with Yuno's official examples and documentation.

| Primary Header | Alias | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| `account-code` | `X-Account-Code` | Both accepted; use `account-code` as primary |

## Sandbox vs Production Keys

Each environment has its own set of API keys:

| Environment | Base URL | Key Type |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Sandbox | `https://api-sandbox.y.uno` | Test keys (no real transactions) |
| Production | `https://api.y.uno` | Live keys (real transactions) |

<Note>
  Sandbox and production keys are not interchangeable. Using sandbox keys against the production URL (or vice versa) will result in authentication errors.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

- Store API keys in environment variables, not in source code
- Use different keys for sandbox and production environments
- Rotate keys periodically through the Yuno Dashboard
- Restrict `private-secret-key` access to server-side code only
- Monitor API usage in the Dashboard for unauthorized access
