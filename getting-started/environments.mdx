## Overview

Yuno provides two environments for API integration:

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Sandbox** | `https://api-sandbox.y.uno` | Testing and development |
| **Production** | `https://api.y.uno` | Live transactions with real funds |

## Sandbox Environment

Use the sandbox for development and testing. Sandbox transactions do not process real payments.

### Sandbox Limitations

- Some payment methods may have limited availability in sandbox
- Test provider credentials may behave differently from production providers
- Certain features may require production enablement before they can be tested in sandbox

<Warning>
  **Currency conversion** (`GET /v1/currency-conversion`) may return 404 in sandbox. This feature requires enablement — contact Yuno support if you need to test currency conversion.
</Warning>

### Test Credentials

Use sandbox-specific API keys from the [Yuno Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno). See the [Testing guide](/guides/testing/sandbox-guide) for test card numbers and payment method-specific test data.

## Production Environment

Production processes real transactions with real funds. Before going live:

1. Complete your integration testing in sandbox
2. Switch to production API keys from the Dashboard
3. Update your base URL from `api-sandbox.y.uno` to `api.y.uno`
4. Verify webhook endpoints are configured for production events
5. Confirm payment methods are enabled for your target countries

<Note>
  API behavior is identical between sandbox and production, with the exception of sandbox-specific limitations noted above.
