description: "Yuno is a payment orchestration platform connecting businesses to 300+ providers and 1000+ payment methods across 190+ countries through a single API"
---

## Overview

Yuno is a payment orchestration platform that gives businesses a single integration point to access over 1000 payment methods, 300+ providers, and 190+ countries. Instead of building and maintaining individual integrations with each payment processor, Yuno abstracts provider complexity behind a unified API.

## What Yuno Does

Yuno sits between your application and payment providers. When a customer pays, Yuno determines the optimal route, handles communication with the provider, manages retries on failure, and returns a normalized response -- regardless of which provider processed the transaction.

```
Your App  -->  Yuno API  -->  Provider A (primary)
                          -->  Provider B (fallback)
                          -->  Provider C (regional)
```

## Multi-Provider Orchestration

With Yuno, you can connect multiple providers for the same payment method. Yuno routes each transaction based on rules you configure:

- **Cost optimization** -- Route to the provider with the lowest processing fees
- **Approval rate optimization** -- Route based on historical success rates by BIN, country, or amount
- **Failover** -- Automatically retry with a backup provider when the primary declines
- **Geographic routing** -- Use local acquirers for domestic transactions to improve approval rates

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Smart Routing** | Rule-based and AI-driven transaction routing across providers |
| **Payment Optimization** | Automatic retries, cascading, and provider failover |
| **Unified API** | Single API contract for cards, bank transfers, wallets, vouchers, and more |
| **Tokenization** | PCI-compliant card vaulting with network tokenization support |
| **Analytics** | Real-time dashboards for approval rates, provider performance, and costs |
| **No-code configuration** | Manage providers, routing rules, and payment methods from the Dashboard |

## Who Uses Yuno

Yuno is built for businesses processing payments in Latin America and globally:

- **E-commerce platforms** needing local payment methods (PIX, OXXO, PSE, Boleto)
- **Marketplaces** requiring split payments and multi-provider routing
- **SaaS companies** managing recurring billing across regions
- **Enterprise merchants** optimizing approval rates and reducing processing costs
