## Overview

Yuno is a payment orchestration platform that gives businesses a single integration point to access over 1000 payment methods, 300+ providers, and 190+ countries. Instead of building and maintaining individual integrations with each payment processor, Yuno abstracts provider complexity behind a unified API.

## What Yuno Does

Yuno sits between your application and payment providers. When a customer pays, Yuno determines the optimal route, handles communication with the provider, manages retries on failure, and returns a normalized response -- regardless of which provider processed the transaction.

```
Your App  -->  Yuno API  -->  Provider A (primary)
                          -->  Provider B (fallback)
                          -->  Provider C (regional)
```

## Multi-Provider Orchestration

With Yuno, you can connect multiple providers for the same payment method. Yuno routes each transaction based on rules you configure:

- **Cost optimization** -- Route to the provider with the lowest processing fees
- **Approval rate optimization** -- Route based on historical success rates by BIN, country, or amount
- **Failover** -- Automatically retry with a backup provider when the primary declines
- **Geographic routing** -- Use local acquirers for domestic transactions to improve approval rates

## Key Capabilities
