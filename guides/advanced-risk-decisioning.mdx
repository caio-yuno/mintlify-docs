## Overview

Yuno's risk engine evaluates every transaction against multiple signals to produce a risk score between 0 (lowest risk) and 100 (highest risk). You can configure custom rules that use these signals to automatically approve, decline, send to manual review, or trigger 3DS challenges for transactions.

<Info>
Risk scoring runs automatically on every payment. No additional integration is required to benefit from baseline fraud detection. Custom rules extend the default behavior.
</Info>

## Risk Signals

The risk engine collects and analyzes signals across several categories. Each signal contributes to the composite risk score.

### Device Fingerprinting

Device fingerprinting creates a unique identifier based on the customer's browser and device characteristics:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Browser type and version | Identifies the browser engine and release |
| Operating system | OS type, version, and architecture |
| Screen resolution | Display dimensions and pixel density |
| Installed plugins | Active browser extensions and plugins |
| Timezone and locale | System timezone offset and language settings |
| Canvas fingerprint | Rendered graphics hash for device identification |
| WebGL renderer | GPU and driver information |

<Note>
Device fingerprinting is collected automatically through the Yuno Web SDK. Direct API integrations must include the `device_fingerprint` field obtained from the SDK's `getDeviceFingerprint()` method.
</Note>

### Behavioral Analytics

Behavioral signals analyze how the customer interacts with the checkout page:

| Signal | Description | Risk Indicator |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Typing speed | Keystroke timing on form fields | Bot-like speed suggests automation |
| Mouse patterns | Movement trajectories and click patterns | Linear paths suggest scripted input |
| Session duration | Time from page load to payment submission | Very fast sessions indicate automated attacks |
| Copy-paste detection | Whether card data was pasted vs. typed | Pasted data may indicate carding |
| Field focus sequence | Order in which form fields are completed | Unusual sequences flag automated tools |

### Velocity Checks

Velocity checks detect unusual transaction volumes within time windows:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Transactions per card | Number of transactions from the same card within a time period |
| Transactions per email | Number of transactions from the same email address |
| Transactions per IP | Number of transactions from the same IP address |
| Transactions per device | Number of transactions from the same device fingerprint |
| Amount per card per day | Total transaction value from a card within 24 hours |
| Unique cards per email | Number of distinct cards used with the same email |
| Unique emails per card | Number of distinct emails used with the same card |

### Geolocation

Geolocation compares the customer's IP-derived location against their billing and shipping information:

| Signal | Description | Risk Indicator |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| IP country vs. billing country | Location mismatch | High risk if countries differ significantly |
| IP city vs. shipping city | Delivery location mismatch | Moderate risk if distant |
| VPN/proxy detection | Whether the IP belongs to a known VPN or proxy | Higher risk with anonymous IPs |
| IP reputation | Historical fraud association of the IP | Known bad IPs flag immediately |

### BIN Analysis

Bank Identification Number (BIN) analysis examines the first 6-8 digits of the card:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Card type | Credit, debit, or prepaid |
| Issuing bank | The bank that issued the card |
| Issuer country | Country where the card was issued |
| Card level | Standard, gold, platinum, corporate |
| Prepaid flag | Whether the card is prepaid (higher risk for some merchants) |

## Aida Fraud Detection

Aida is Yuno's AI-powered fraud detection engine. It uses machine learning models trained on aggregated transaction data across the Yuno network to detect fraud patterns.

### How Aida Works

1. **Feature extraction**: Aida extracts 200+ features from each transaction, combining raw signals with computed features (e.g., deviation from customer's normal spending pattern).
2. **Model scoring**: Multiple models evaluate the transaction simultaneously, including supervised models trained on confirmed fraud and unsupervised models detecting anomalies.
3. **Score aggregation**: Individual model scores are combined into a single risk score, weighted by model performance on your merchant segment.
4. **Recommendation**: Aida outputs a recommendation (approve, decline, review) based on the composite score and your configured thresholds.

<Note>
Aida's models improve over time as more transactions flow through your account. Marking transactions as fraudulent in the Dashboard feeds the model and improves accuracy.
</Note>

## Configuring Custom Risk Rules

Custom rules extend the default risk engine with merchant-specific logic. Configure rules in the Dashboard under **Risk > Rules**.

### Rule Structure

Each rule consists of:

- **Conditions**: One or more checks that must evaluate to `true`
- **Action**: What to do when all conditions are met
- **Priority**: Execution order (lower number = higher priority)
- **Status**: Enabled or disabled

### Rule Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPROVE` | Skip further risk checks and approve the transaction |
| `DECLINE` | Reject the transaction immediately |
| `REVIEW` | Flag for manual review in the Dashboard |
| `3DS_CHALLENGE` | Trigger 3D Secure authentication before proceeding |

### Creating a Rule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboard > Risk > Rules" />
  <Step title="Click 'Create Rule'" />
  <Step title="Define conditions using the field selector">
    Select a field, operator, and value for each condition. Multiple conditions use AND logic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the action to apply when conditions match" />
  <Step title="Set priority (1 = highest)" />
  <Step title="Enable the rule and save" />
</Steps>

### Rule Condition Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `equals` | Exact match | `card.issuer_country equals US` |
| `not_equals` | Not equal | `card.type not_equals PREPAID` |
| `greater_than` | Numeric comparison | `amount.value greater_than 500` |
| `less_than` | Numeric comparison | `risk_score less_than 20` |
| `in` | Value in list | `customer.country in [BR, MX, CO]` |
| `not_in` | Value not in list | `card.issuer_country not_in [NG, GH]` |
| `contains` | String contains | `customer.email contains @tempmail` |
| `regex` | Regular expression | `customer.phone regex ^\\+55` |

## Common Risk Rule Examples

| Rule | Conditions | Action | Use Case |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Block disposable emails | `customer.email contains @tempmail OR @throwaway` | DECLINE | Prevent fraud from temporary emails |
| Low-risk fast approval | `risk_score less_than 15 AND customer.is_returning equals true` | APPROVE | Speed up checkout for trusted customers |
| High-value 3DS | `amount.value greater_than 1000` | 3DS_CHALLENGE | Extra verification for large purchases |
| Prepaid card review | `card.type equals PREPAID AND amount.value greater_than 200` | REVIEW | Manual check for high-value prepaid card transactions |
| Velocity block | `velocity.card_txn_1h greater_than 5` | DECLINE | Block rapid-fire card testing |
| Country mismatch | `card.issuer_country not_equals customer.country` | 3DS_CHALLENGE | Verify cross-border card usage |
| VPN detection | `device.is_vpn equals true AND risk_score greater_than 50` | REVIEW | Flag suspicious VPN usage |
| New device + high amount | `device.is_new equals true AND amount.value greater_than 500` | 3DS_CHALLENGE | Extra check for unfamiliar devices |
| Trusted BIN approval | `card.bin in [411111, 520000] AND risk_score less_than 30` | APPROVE | Fast-track known low-risk BINs |
| Bot-like behavior | `behavior.session_duration_ms less_than 3000` | DECLINE | Block automated submissions |

<Warning>
Test new rules in sandbox environment before enabling in production. Overly aggressive rules can increase false positives and decline legitimate transactions.
</Warning>

## Monitoring Risk Performance

Track the effectiveness of your risk configuration in the Dashboard under **Risk > Analytics**:

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **False positive rate** | Legitimate transactions incorrectly declined | Below 2% |
| **Catch rate** | Fraudulent transactions correctly identified | Above 90% |
| **Review rate** | Percentage of transactions sent to manual review | Below 5% |
| **3DS challenge rate** | Percentage of transactions requiring 3DS | Below 15% |
| **Chargeback rate** | Chargebacks as percentage of total transactions | Below 0.5% |

### Performance Dashboard

The risk analytics dashboard provides:

- **Real-time score distribution**: Histogram of risk scores across transactions
- **Rule hit rates**: How often each rule triggers
- **Action breakdown**: Distribution of approve, decline, review, and 3DS actions
- **Trend analysis**: Risk metrics over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **False positive reports**: Transactions flagged for review that were later confirmed legitimate

## Machine Learning Feedback Loop

Improve Aida's accuracy by providing feedback on transaction outcomes:

1. **Mark chargebacks**: When a chargeback is received, mark the original transaction in Dashboard > Payments.
2. **Resolve reviews**: Approve or decline transactions in the manual review queue with the reason.
3. **Report fraud**: Flag transactions identified as fraudulent through other channels.

<Info>
Feedback is incorporated into Aida's models during periodic retraining. Consistent feedback on both fraudulent and legitimate transactions produces the best model performance.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Start with monitoring mode**: Enable new rules in "log only" mode before applying actions. Review the logged matches before activating enforcement.
- **Layer rules by priority**: Use high-priority rules for known good/bad patterns and lower-priority rules for nuanced checks.
- **Review regularly**: Audit rule performance monthly. Disable rules with high false positive rates.
- **Combine signals**: Single-signal rules are prone to false positives. Combine multiple conditions (e.g., VPN + high amount + new device) for precision.
- **Avoid over-blocking**: Declining too aggressively hurts revenue more than fraud. Prefer 3DS challenges and manual review over outright declines for borderline cases.
- **Feed the model**: Consistently mark chargebacks and fraud in the Dashboard to improve Aida's accuracy over time.
