## Overview

Refunds return funds to the customer after a payment has been captured. Yuno supports both full refunds (entire amount) and partial refunds (a portion of the original amount).

<Note>
Refunds can only be issued for payments with status `SUCCEEDED`. For authorized but uncaptured payments, use [Cancel](/guides/direct-api/capture-and-cancel) instead (no processing fees).
</Note>

## Create a Full Refund

```javascript
const refund = await fetch(
  `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/${paymentId}/refunds`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'public-api-key': process.env.YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
      'private-secret-key': process.env.YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
      'account-code': process.env.YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      reason: 'Customer requested refund',
    }),
  }
);
const refundResult = await refund.json();
```

## Create a Partial Refund

Specify the amount to refund:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const partialRefund = await fetch(
  `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/${paymentId}/refunds`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'public-api-key': process.env.YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
      'private-secret-key': process.env.YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
      'account-code': process.env.YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: { currency: 'USD', value: 25.00 },
      reason: 'Partial refund - item returned',
    }),
  }
);
```

```python Python
import requests

partial_refund = requests.post(
    f'https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/refunds',
    headers={
        'public-api-key': YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
        'private-secret-key': YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
        'account-code': YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    json={
        'amount': {'currency': 'USD', 'value': 25.00},
        'reason': 'Partial refund - item returned',
    },
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Refund Response

```json
{
  "id": "ref_xyz789",
  "payment_id": "pay_abc123",
  "status": "SUCCEEDED",
  "amount": { "currency": "USD", "value": 25.00 },
  "reason": "Partial refund - item returned",
  "created_at": "2026-02-28T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Refund Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SUCCEEDED` | Refund processed and funds returned |
| `PENDING` | Refund submitted, awaiting provider confirmation |
| `FAILED` | Refund could not be processed |

## Multiple Partial Refunds

You can issue multiple partial refunds against a single payment, as long as the total refunded amount does not exceed the original captured amount:

```
Original payment: $100.00
First partial refund:  -$30.00 (remaining: $70.00)
Second partial refund: -$20.00 (remaining: $50.00)
```

<Warning>
Attempting to refund more than the remaining capturable amount will result in an error. Track cumulative refunds on your side for accurate reconciliation.
</Warning>

## Refund Timelines

Refund processing time depends on the payment method and provider:

| Payment Method | Typical Timeline |
|---------------|------------------|
| Credit Card | 5-10 business days |
| Debit Card | 3-5 business days |
| PIX | Instant to 1 business day |
| Bank Transfer | 3-7 business days |

## Best Practices

- Always include a descriptive `reason` for audit and reconciliation purposes
- Use webhooks to track refund status changes asynchronously
- Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate refund requests
- Prefer cancel/void over refund for same-day reversals to minimize fees
- Keep a log mapping refund IDs to order/item-level details
