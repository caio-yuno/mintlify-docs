  <Card title="Full Checkout" icon="window-maximize" href="/guides/sdk/full-checkout">
    **Fastest path to production.** Yuno renders a complete checkout UI with all enabled payment methods. Ideal for merchants who want a turnkey solution with minimal frontend work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lite Checkout" icon="window-restore" href="/guides/sdk/lite-checkout">
    **Balanced approach.** Embed a Yuno payment form in your existing checkout page. You control the page layout while Yuno handles the payment form and PCI compliance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Fields" icon="lock" href="/guides/sdk/secure-fields">
    **Maximum UI control.** Embed individual card input fields (number, expiry, CVV) as secure iframes. Build a fully custom card form while maintaining SAQ-A compliance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct API" icon="code" href="/guides/direct-api/overview">
    **Full server-side control.** Integrate directly with the Yuno REST API for complete flexibility. Requires PCI DSS Level 1 certification for handling raw card data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Decision Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Do you need to handle raw card data server-side?">
    **Yes** -- Use [Direct API](/guides/direct-api/overview). You must be PCI DSS Level 1 certified.

    **No** -- Continue to the next question.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do you need full control over card input field design?">
    **Yes** -- Use [Secure Fields](/guides/sdk/secure-fields). You get full CSS control over individual inputs.

    **No** -- Continue to the next question.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do you want to embed the payment form in your page?">
    **Yes** -- Use [Lite Checkout](/guides/sdk/lite-checkout). The form integrates into your checkout page.

    **No** -- Use [Full Checkout](/guides/sdk/full-checkout) for a complete hosted experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## PCI Compliance

<Warning>
Your PCI compliance obligations differ significantly based on your integration choice. Direct API requires PCI DSS Level 1 (the most stringent), while SDK-based integrations qualify for SAQ-A (the simplest self-assessment).
</Warning>

| Integration | PCI Level | What It Means |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Full Checkout | SAQ-A | Card data never touches your servers or pages |
| Lite Checkout | SAQ-A | Card data handled in Yuno-managed iframes |
| Secure Fields | SAQ-A | Individual fields rendered in secure iframes |
| Direct API | SAQ-D Level 1 | You handle, transmit, and store card data |

## Next Steps

After choosing your integration, follow the corresponding guide to get started. All integrations share the same [server-side payment creation](/guides/direct-api/create-payment) and [webhook handling](/guides/webhooks/setup).
