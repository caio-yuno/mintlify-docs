## Overview

Card payments are the most common payment method and are available in all Yuno-supported countries. Cards can be processed with or without 3D Secure authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Checkout session created with your server
- SDK initialized on the client (for SDK integrations)
- 3DS handling via `continuePayment()` (recommended)

## Payment Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create checkout session">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/checkout/sessions \
      -H "public-api-key: $PUBLIC_KEY" \
      -H "private-secret-key: $PRIVATE_KEY" \
      -H "account-code: $ACCOUNT_CODE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 150.00}, "country": "BR", "merchant_order_id": "card-001"}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create payment with card data">
    ```json
    {
      "checkout_session": "session-id",
      "payment_method": {
        "type": "CARD",
        "token": "one-time-token-from-sdk"
      },
      "amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 150.00},
      "country": "BR",
      "customer": {
        "document": {"document_type": "CPF", "document_number": "12345678901"},
        "email": "customer@example.com"
      },
      "installments": 3
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle 3DS if required">
    Call `yuno.continuePayment()` to handle the 3DS challenge automatically. See [Continue Payment](/guides/sdk/continue-payment).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installments

Card payments in Latin America commonly support installments. Include the `installments` field with the number of installments. Configure installment plans via the [Installments Plans API](/api-reference/installments-plans/create).

## 3DS Authentication

3DS is recommended for all card transactions to shift liability to the issuer. See [ECI Indicators](/reference-lists/eci-indicators) for authentication result codes.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Card declined | Insufficient funds or issuer block | Try another card or check [MAC codes](/reference-lists/merchant-advice-codes) |
| Invalid card number | Incorrect card number format | Verify the card number |
| Expired card | Card past expiration date | Use a valid card |
| 3DS authentication failed | Customer did not complete 3DS | Retry or use a different card |
