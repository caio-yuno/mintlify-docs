## Overview

Payment Links provide a hosted payment page that you can share with customers via email, SMS, or messaging apps. No frontend integration is required.

## How It Works

1. Create a checkout session with your server
2. Use the checkout session URL as a payment link
3. Share the link with your customer
4. The customer completes payment on the hosted page
5. Receive payment status via webhooks

## Creating a Payment Link

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -H "public-api-key: $PUBLIC_KEY" \
  -H "private-secret-key: $PRIVATE_KEY" \
  -H "account-code: $ACCOUNT_CODE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00},
    "country": "BR",
    "merchant_order_id": "link-001",
    "payment_description": "Order #001"
  }'
```

The response includes a URL that you can share directly with the customer.

## Use Cases

- **Invoice payments** — Send payment links in invoices
- **Social commerce** — Share links via WhatsApp, Instagram
- **Phone orders** — Create links during phone conversations
- **Email campaigns** — Include payment links in marketing emails

<Note>
Checkout sessions expire after a configured time period. Generate new links for expired sessions.
