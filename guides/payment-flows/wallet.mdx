## Overview

Wallet payments use tokenized card credentials stored in Google Pay or Apple Pay. This provides a frictionless checkout experience with strong authentication.

## Google Pay

### Prerequisites
- Google Pay enabled in Dashboard
- Domain verified with Google

### Payment Flow

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "session-id",
  "payment_method": {"type": "GOOGLE_PAY"},
  "amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00},
  "country": "BR"
}
```

The SDK handles the Google Pay UI and token generation. The payment token is passed to Yuno for processing.

## Apple Pay

### Prerequisites
- Apple Pay enabled in Dashboard
- Domain verified with Apple
- Valid SSL certificate on your domain

### Payment Flow

```json
{
  "checkout_session": "session-id",
  "payment_method": {"type": "APPLE_PAY"},
  "amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00},
  "country": "BR"
}
```

<Note>
Wallet payments require the Yuno SDK to handle the native payment sheet. Direct API integration is not supported for wallet payment methods.
