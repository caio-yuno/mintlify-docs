## Overview

Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) allows customers to split a purchase into multiple installments, often interest-free. BNPL providers handle the credit risk and pay the merchant upfront, while the customer repays the BNPL provider over time.

Key characteristics:
- **Higher conversion**: Customers are more likely to complete larger purchases
- **Merchant receives full payment**: The BNPL provider pays you upfront (minus fees)
- **Credit risk on provider**: The BNPL provider assumes the risk of customer non-payment
- **Redirect flow**: Customers are redirected to the BNPL provider for approval

## Supported Providers

BNPL availability varies by country and provider configuration:

| Provider | Countries | Currency | Installments |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Provider-specific | Varies | Varies | 3-12 months typical |

<Note>
Available BNPL providers depend on your merchant configuration. Check **Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods** to see which BNPL options are enabled for your account.
</Note>

## Redirect Flow

BNPL payments use a redirect flow where the customer completes approval on the provider's site:

1. **Create payment**: Submit the payment request with `type: "BNPL"`
2. **Redirect customer**: Send the customer to the `redirect_url` from the response
3. **Customer approves**: The customer reviews installment terms and approves on the BNPL provider's site
4. **Callback**: Customer is redirected back to your `callback_url`
5. **Webhook confirmation**: Receive definitive payment status via webhook

## Creating a BNPL Payment

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'public-api-key': process.env.YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
    'private-secret-key': process.env.YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
    'account-code': process.env.YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    checkout_session: 'session-id',
    payment_method: { type: 'BNPL' },
    amount: { currency: 'BRL', value: 800.00 },
    country: 'BR',
    customer: {
      email: 'cliente@example.com',
      first_name: 'Maria',
      last_name: 'Silva',
      document: {
        document_type: 'CPF',
        document_number: '12345678901',
      },
    },
    callback_url: 'https://your-store.com/payment/callback',
    description: 'Order #555',
  }),
});
const payment = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments',
    headers={
        'public-api-key': YUNO_PUBLIC_KEY,
        'private-secret-key': YUNO_PRIVATE_KEY,
        'account-code': YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    json={
        'checkout_session': 'session-id',
        'payment_method': {'type': 'BNPL'},
        'amount': {'currency': 'BRL', 'value': 800.00},
        'country': 'BR',
        'customer': {
            'email': 'cliente@example.com',
            'first_name': 'Maria',
            'last_name': 'Silva',
            'document': {
                'document_type': 'CPF',
                'document_number': '12345678901',
            },
        },
        'callback_url': 'https://your-store.com/payment/callback',
        'description': 'Order #555',
    },
)
payment = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling the Response

```json
{
  "id": "pay_bnpl_abc123",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 800.00 },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "BNPL",
    "redirect_url": "https://bnpl-provider.com/approve/abc123"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Redirect the customer to `redirect_url` immediately after receiving the response:

```javascript
// Client-side redirect
window.location.href = payment.payment_method.redirect_url;
```

## Handling Redirect Callbacks

When the customer completes or cancels the BNPL approval, they are redirected to your `callback_url` with query parameters indicating the result:

```
https://your-store.com/payment/callback?payment_id=pay_bnpl_abc123&status=approved
```

<Warning>
Do not rely on callback URL parameters for fulfillment decisions. The callback redirect may arrive before the payment is fully confirmed. Always use webhooks for definitive payment status.
</Warning>

## Installment Information

When the BNPL payment is approved, the response includes installment details:

```json
{
  "id": "pay_bnpl_abc123",
  "status": "SUCCEEDED",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "BNPL",
    "bnpl": {
      "provider": "bnpl-provider-name",
      "installments": 4,
      "installment_amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 200.00 },
      "total_amount": { "currency": "BRL", "value": 800.00 },
      "first_payment_date": "2026-03-01",
      "last_payment_date": "2026-06-01"
    }
  }
}
```

## Refund Handling

BNPL refunds follow specific rules:

- **Full refunds**: The BNPL provider cancels remaining installments and refunds any paid amounts
- **Partial refunds**: The remaining installment schedule is adjusted proportionally
- Refund processing time depends on the BNPL provider (typically 5-10 business days)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{payment_id}/refund \
  -H "public-api-key: your-public-api-key" \
  -H "private-secret-key: your-private-secret-key" \
  -H "account-code: your-account-code" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 800.00}}'
```

<Note>
BNPL refund policies vary by provider. Some providers may not support partial refunds. Check your provider's specific terms in the Dashboard.
</Note>

## Country Availability

BNPL availability depends on provider partnerships in each country. Contact your Yuno account manager or check **Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods** to see available BNPL options for your target markets.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Missing `redirect_url` | `callback_url` not provided | Add `callback_url` to the payment request |
| Customer denied by BNPL provider | Customer failed credit check | This is expected; offer alternative payment methods |
| Payment stuck in `PENDING` | Customer did not complete approval | Set a timeout and offer to retry or use another method |
| 403: `payment method not available` | BNPL not enabled | Enable BNPL in **Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods** |
