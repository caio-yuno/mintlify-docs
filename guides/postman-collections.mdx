## Overview

Yuno provides a public Postman workspace with pre-built collections covering the full API surface. Use these collections to explore the API, test payment flows, and prototype integrations without writing code.

## Forking the Yuno Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Yuno Postman workspace">
    Navigate to [Yuno's public Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/yuno-payments) and browse the available collections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fork the collection">
    Click the **Fork** icon on the collection you want to use. Forking creates a personal copy in your Postman workspace that stays linked to the original for updates.

    - Enter a label for your fork (e.g., "My Yuno Integration")
    - Select your target workspace
    - Click **Fork Collection**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fork the environment">
    Fork the **Yuno Sbx - Postman** environment alongside the collection. This environment contains the variable structure you need for authentication and request configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Forking rather than exporting keeps your copy linked to the original. When Yuno updates the collection, you can pull changes into your fork.
</Note>

## Environment Setup

The **Yuno Sbx - Postman** environment provides pre-configured variables for sandbox testing. After forking, update the following variables with your credentials:

| Variable | Description | Where to Find |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `public-api-key` | Client-side API key | Dashboard > Settings > API Keys |
| `private-secret-key` | Server-side secret key | Dashboard > Settings > API Keys |
| `account-code` | Merchant account identifier | Dashboard > Settings > API Keys |

### Configuring Variables

1. In Postman, click **Environments** in the sidebar
2. Select **Yuno Sbx - Postman**
3. Enter your values in the **Current Value** column for each variable
4. Click **Save**

<Warning>
Never share your `private-secret-key` or commit Postman environments with real credentials to version control. Use Postman's "Current Value" field, which is local to your machine and not synced to shared workspaces.
</Warning>

### Additional Environment Variables

The collection uses these auto-populated variables for request chaining:

| Variable | Description | Auto-populated |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `checkout-session-id` | ID from Create Checkout Session response | Yes |
| `payment-id` | ID from Create Payment response | Yes |
| `customer-id` | ID from Create Customer response | Yes |
| `base-url` | Yuno API base URL | Pre-configured |

## Collection Structure

The Yuno Postman collection is organized by API resource:

| Folder | Endpoints | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Checkout Sessions** | Create, retrieve, list | Manage checkout session lifecycle |
| **Payments** | Create, capture, cancel, refund | Full payment operations |
| **Customers** | Create, update, retrieve | Customer profile management |
| **Payment Methods** | List, retrieve | Query available payment methods |
| **Providers** | List connections | View configured provider connections |
| **Webhooks** | Test delivery | Simulate webhook events |

Each request includes:
- Pre-configured headers (authorization, content-type)
- Example request body with documented fields
- Test scripts that auto-save response IDs to environment variables

## Running Your First Request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the environment">
    In the top-right corner of Postman, select **Yuno Sbx - Postman** from the environment dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Create Checkout Session">
    Navigate to **Checkout Sessions > Create Checkout Session** in the collection sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the request body">
    The request body is pre-populated with a valid example. Review and modify fields as needed:

    ```json
    {
      "amount": {
        "currency": "BRL",
        "value": 100
      },
      "country": "BR",
      "merchant_order_id": "order-test-001",
      "payment_description": "Test payment"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the request">
    Click **Send**. A successful response returns a `201` status with the checkout session object. The `checkout_session_id` is automatically saved to your environment variables.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue the flow">
    Use the saved `checkout_session_id` in subsequent requests like **Create Payment** to complete the payment flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request Chaining

The collection uses Postman test scripts to chain requests automatically. When you run a request, the response ID is saved to an environment variable and referenced by the next request in the flow:

```
Create Checkout Session → saves checkout-session-id
    ↓
Create Payment → uses checkout-session-id, saves payment-id
    ↓
Capture Payment → uses payment-id
```

This allows you to run a complete payment flow sequentially without manually copying IDs between requests.

## Testing with Different Payment Methods

The collection includes example request bodies for common payment methods:

| Payment Method | Country | Key Fields |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Card** | Multiple | `card.number`, `card.cvv`, `card.expiration_month/year` |
| **PIX** | BR | `customer.document` (CPF/CNPJ) |
| **OXXO** | MX | `customer.email` |
| **Bank Transfer** | CO | `customer.document`, `customer.phone` |

Switch between payment method examples by selecting the corresponding request variant within each folder.

<Note>
Sandbox test credentials and card numbers are documented in the request descriptions. Use the provided test values for consistent results.
</Note>

## Sharing with Your Team

Share your configured collection with team members:

1. **Postman Team Workspace:** Move your fork to a team workspace so all members have access
2. **Environment management:** Create a shared environment with non-sensitive variables (`account-code`, `base-url`) and instruct members to add their own `private-secret-key` locally
3. **Collection updates:** When Yuno updates the source collection, pull changes into your fork via **Pull Changes** in the fork menu

<Warning>
Shared Postman workspaces sync environment variables. Ensure `private-secret-key` is set only in the **Current Value** column (local, not synced) and not in the **Initial Value** column (synced to workspace).
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Keep your fork updated.** Regularly pull changes from the Yuno source collection to get new endpoints and fixes.
- **Use environment variables for all dynamic values.** Avoid hardcoding IDs, keys, or tokens in request bodies.
- **Run requests in sequence for payment flows.** The chaining scripts depend on running requests in the correct order.
- **Review test scripts.** The collection includes assertions that validate response structure. Run them as part of your testing to catch integration issues early.
- **Create separate environments for sandbox and production.** Duplicate the environment, update credentials, and switch between them using the environment selector.
