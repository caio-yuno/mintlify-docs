## Overview

After creating a payment server-side, some payment methods require additional steps before completion:

- **3D Secure (3DS)** — Card payments may require cardholder authentication
- **Redirect flows** — PSE, SPEI, and bank transfers redirect the customer to complete payment
- **Async methods** — PIX, Boleto, and OXXO generate payment instructions for the customer

The `continuePayment()` method handles these scenarios automatically.

## Usage

After your server creates the payment and returns the result to the client:

```javascript
// Client-side: after receiving payment result from server
yuno.continuePayment();
```

The SDK will automatically:
1. Detect if 3DS authentication is needed and display the challenge
2. Handle redirect-based payment methods
3. Display payment instructions (QR codes, vouchers) for async methods

## 3DS Flow

For card payments with 3DS:

```
Client → Server: Create payment
Server → Yuno API: POST /v1/payments
Yuno API → Server: Payment requires 3DS
Server → Client: Return payment result
Client: yuno.continuePayment() → displays 3DS challenge
Customer: Completes authentication
SDK → Callback: Payment result (success/failure)
```

## Handling Results

Listen for payment completion in your SDK callbacks:

```javascript
yuno.startCheckout({
  // ...
  yunoCreatePayment: async (token) => {
    const result = await createPaymentOnServer(token);
    return result;
  },
});

// continuePayment handles the rest automatically
yuno.continuePayment();
```

## Webhooks for Async Payments

For payment methods like PIX, Boleto, and OXXO, the payment status is `PENDING` after creation. Set up [webhooks](/guides/webhooks/overview) to receive the final payment status when the customer completes the payment.
