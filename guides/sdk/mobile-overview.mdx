## Integration types

All Yuno mobile SDKs offer multiple integration levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full SDK" icon="credit-card">
    Renders all available payment methods in a pre-built checkout UI. Fastest integration path with minimal code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lite SDK" icon="bolt">
    You control which payment methods are shown. Yuno handles the payment form and tokenization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Seamless SDK" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options. Recommended for most integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Headless SDK" icon="code">
    Full control over the UI. Yuno handles tokenization and PCI compliance behind the scenes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Shared architecture

All Yuno mobile SDKs follow the same integration pattern:

1. **Create a checkout session** server-side via the [Checkout Sessions API](/api-reference/checkout-sessions/create)
2. **Initialize the SDK** with your public API key and `YunoConfig`
3. **Start the checkout** by passing the session token to the SDK
4. **Handle the one-time token (OTT)** — the SDK generates a token you use to create the payment server-side
5. **Call `continuePayment()`** — after creating the payment, call this method so the SDK can handle async flows (3DS, redirects)
6. **Handle callbacks** for payment success, error, processing, reject, and cancellation states
7. **Verify payment status** server-side via webhooks or the [GET Payment API](/api-reference/payments/retrieve)

<Warning>
Never use your private secret key in mobile apps. Only the public API key should be embedded in client-side code. All payment creation and verification must happen server-side.
</Warning>

## Payment status states

All mobile SDKs return these payment states through their callbacks:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `succeeded` / `SUCCEEDED` | Payment completed successfully |
| `fail` / `FAIL` | Payment failed due to an error |
| `processing` / `PROCESSING` | Payment is being processed (async methods) |
| `reject` / `REJECT` | Payment was rejected (insufficient funds, fraud, etc.) |
| `internalError` / `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected server-side error |
| `userCancell` / `CANCELED` | User cancelled the payment flow |

<Note>
The exact enum names vary by platform (Swift uses camelCase, Kotlin uses UPPER_CASE), but the semantics are identical.
