## Integration Options

Yuno offers three SDK integration modes, each providing different levels of customization.

| Mode | Description | Customization | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Full Checkout** | Pre-built, hosted checkout UI | Low | Low |
| **SDK Lite** | Embeddable payment form in your page | Medium | Medium |
| **Headless** | API-only, build your own UI | Full | High |

## SDK Lite (Recommended)

SDK Lite is the most popular integration mode. It embeds a lightweight payment form directly in your checkout page while Yuno handles PCI compliance and payment processing.

See the [SDK Lite guide](/guides/sdk/sdk-lite) for complete integration instructions.

## Installation

Install the Yuno Web SDK via npm or CDN:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web
```

```html CDN
<script src="https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1/static/js/main.js"></script>
```
</CodeGroup>

## SDK Versions

When integrating, always check the latest version of `@yuno-payments/sdk-web` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web) to ensure compatibility.

<Warning>
If you are upgrading from a previous SDK version, review the [migration notes](https://github.com/yuno-payments) for breaking changes in the initialization API.
</Warning>
