## Which integration should I use?

Yuno offers multiple SDK integration types. For most merchants, **Full Checkout** or **Seamless Checkout** is the right choice.

## Full Checkout (Recommended)

Full Checkout is the fastest path to accepting payments. Mount it with a single call and Yuno renders the entire checkout UI — payment method selection, card forms, alternative methods, and 3DS handling — all included.

**Why start here:**
- **Fastest time-to-value** — one mount call, ~10 lines of code
- **All payment methods** render automatically based on your configuration
- **SAQ-A compliance** — zero card data touches your servers
- **Production-ready** — responsive, accessible, localized out of the box

Get started with the [Full Checkout integration guide](/guides/sdk/full-checkout).

## Seamless Checkout

Seamless Checkout combines SDK convenience with control over payment method selection. Yuno handles the payment form and creates payments in a single flow — you control which methods to show and when.

**Why use Seamless:**
- **Single-flow payment creation** — the only integration that handles token-to-payment seamlessly
- **Payment method control** — you decide which methods to display
- **External buttons** — mount Apple Pay and Google Pay buttons anywhere in your UI
- **Low development effort** — similar to Full Checkout with more flexibility

Get started with the [Seamless Checkout integration guide](/guides/sdk/seamless-checkout).

## Advanced integrations

For merchants who need more control over the checkout experience:

### Lite Checkout

Embed a payment form directly in your page with full layout control. Yuno supplies available payment methods; you decide which to display and manage the UI.

See the [Lite Checkout guide](/guides/sdk/lite-checkout).

### Secure Fields

Individual, tokenized input fields (card number, expiry, CVV) that you place and style independently. Web only.

See the [Secure Fields guide](/guides/sdk/secure-fields).

### Headless

Build your own checkout UI from scratch. You collect card data, Yuno handles tokenization and 3DS. Maximum flexibility, highest integration effort.

See the [Headless guide](/guides/sdk/headless).

## Installation

Install the Yuno Web SDK via npm or CDN:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web
```

```html CDN
<script src="https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1/static/js/main.js"></script>
```
</CodeGroup>

## SDK Versions

When integrating, always check the latest version of `@yuno-payments/sdk-web` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web) to ensure compatibility.

<Warning>
If you are upgrading from a previous SDK version, review the [migration notes](https://github.com/yuno-payments) for breaking changes in the initialization API.
</Warning>
