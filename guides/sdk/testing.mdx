## Sandbox Environment

Use the sandbox environment for all testing. Sandbox transactions do not process real payments.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Base URL | `https://api-sandbox.y.uno` |
| API Keys | Sandbox keys from Dashboard |

## Test Card Numbers

Use these card numbers in the sandbox environment:

| Card Number | Result | Brand |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `4111111111111111` | Approved | Visa |
| `5500000000000004` | Approved | Mastercard |
| `378282246310005` | Approved | Amex |
| `4000000000000002` | Declined | Visa |
| `4000000000000069` | Expired Card | Visa |
| `4000000000000127` | Incorrect CVV | Visa |

<Note>
Test card numbers work only in the sandbox environment. Use any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVV (4 digits for Amex).
