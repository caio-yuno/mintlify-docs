## Overview

The Yuno Testing Gateway is a built-in simulated provider that allows you to test the full payment flow without configuring real provider credentials. It supports cards, PIX, bank transfers, and other payment methods in a controlled sandbox environment.

<Note>
The Testing Gateway is available by default in all sandbox accounts. No additional configuration is required to start using it.
</Note>

## Supported Payment Methods

| Payment Method | Testing Gateway Support | Simulated Behaviors |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Credit/Debit Cards | Yes | Approve, decline, 3DS, timeout |
| PIX | Yes | QR code generation, instant confirmation |
| Bank Transfer | Yes | Redirect simulation, pending status |
| OXXO | Yes | Voucher generation |
| PSE | Yes | Bank selection, redirect flow |

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Testing Gateway">
    Navigate to **Dashboard > Connections** in your sandbox environment. The Yuno Testing Gateway should appear as an available provider. If not enabled, toggle it on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set routing rules (optional)">
    By default, sandbox routes all transactions through the Testing Gateway. To test specific routing scenarios, configure rules in **Dashboard > Routing Rules**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send test transactions">
    Use [test cards](/guides/testing/test-cards) and the standard API flow. The Testing Gateway processes the transaction and returns simulated responses.

    ```javascript
    const payment = await fetch('https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { /* sandbox auth headers */ },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        checkout_session: 'session-id',
        payment_method: { type: 'CARD', token: 'test-token' },
        amount: { currency: 'BRL', value: 50.00 },
        country: 'BR',
      }),
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify results">
    Check the payment status in the API response or in **Dashboard > Payments**. The Testing Gateway provides realistic response structures matching real provider formats.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Simulating Specific Outcomes

The Testing Gateway determines the outcome based on the test card number used:

| Test Card | Simulated Outcome |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `4111111111111111` | Approved |
| `4000000000000002` | Declined (generic) |
| `4000000000009995` | Declined (insufficient funds) |
| `4000000000003220` | 3DS challenge required |

For non-card methods (PIX, bank transfer), the Testing Gateway always returns a successful pending status with simulated payment details (QR codes, redirect URLs).

## Testing Webhooks

The Testing Gateway triggers webhook events just like a real provider:

| Event | When Triggered |
|-------|---------------|
| `payment.created` | Payment submitted |
| `payment.succeeded` | Payment approved |
| `payment.failed` | Payment declined |
| `payment.pending` | Async payment awaiting confirmation |
| `refund.succeeded` | Refund processed |

<Warning>
Some webhook event types may return 404 in sandbox. This is a known sandbox limitation. See [Webhook Setup](/guides/webhooks/setup) for details.
</Warning>

## Limitations

- The Testing Gateway is only available in sandbox environments
- Response times are instant (does not simulate real provider latency)
- Settlement and reconciliation flows are not simulated
- Provider-specific error codes are generic simulations

## Transitioning to Real Providers

When moving to production:

1. Configure real provider credentials in **Dashboard > Connections**
2. Update routing rules to point to production providers
3. Switch API keys and base URL to production
4. The Testing Gateway is not available in production
