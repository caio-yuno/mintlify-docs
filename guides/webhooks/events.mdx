## Overview

Yuno sends webhook events to notify your server about changes to payments, subscriptions, payouts, customers, disputes, and BaaS resources. Each event contains the full resource state at the time of the event.

<Note>
Process events idempotently. You may receive the same event multiple times due to retries. Use the `id` and `timestamp` fields to detect and deduplicate events.
</Note>

## Event Payload Structure

All webhook events follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "event": "payment.succeeded",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    // Full resource object at the time of the event
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique event identifier |
| `event` | `string` | Event type (e.g., `payment.succeeded`) |
| `timestamp` | `string` | ISO 8601 datetime when the event occurred |
| `data` | `object` | Full resource object (payment, subscription, payout, etc.) |

## Best Practices

- **Process idempotently.** Use the event `id` to detect and skip duplicate deliveries.
- **Handle out-of-order events.** Use the `timestamp` field to ensure you process events in the correct sequence. A `payment.succeeded` event may arrive before `payment.created` in rare cases.
- **Verify signatures.** Validate the webhook signature header to confirm events originate from Yuno.
- **Respond quickly.** Return a `200` status within 5 seconds. Process events asynchronously if your logic takes longer.
- **Log all events.** Store raw event payloads for debugging and audit purposes.
- **Handle retries.** Yuno retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff. If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status, Yuno will retry up to 5 times.
