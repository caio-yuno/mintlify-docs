## Event Types

| Event | Description | Triggered When |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `payment.created` | Payment was created | A new payment is initiated |
| `payment.updated` | Payment status changed | Payment succeeds, fails, or changes state |
| `payment.refunded` | Payment was refunded | A refund is processed |
| `payout.created` | Payout was created | A new payout is initiated |
| `payout.updated` | Payout status changed | Payout succeeds or fails |
| `customer.created` | Customer was created | A new customer record is created |

## Payment Status Transitions

```
PENDING → SUCCEEDED
PENDING → DECLINED
PENDING → CANCELLED
AUTHORIZED → CAPTURED (SUCCEEDED)
AUTHORIZED → CANCELLED
SUCCEEDED → REFUNDED
SUCCEEDED → PARTIALLY_REFUNDED
```

## Event Payload Structure

All events follow this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "string",
  "data": { },
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

The `data` object contains the full resource (payment, payout, customer) at the time of the event.

## Best Practices

- Process events idempotently — you may receive the same event multiple times
- Use the `timestamp` field to handle out-of-order events
- Store the payment `id` and `status` to detect duplicate events
- Log all received events for debugging and audit purposes
