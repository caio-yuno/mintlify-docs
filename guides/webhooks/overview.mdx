## Overview

Webhooks notify your server when payment events occur (e.g., payment succeeded, payment failed). This is essential for asynchronous payment methods like PIX, Boleto, and OXXO.

## Configuration

Configure webhook endpoints in the [Yuno Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno) under **Settings > Webhooks**.

<Warning>
**Sandbox limitation:** Webhook management endpoints (`POST /v1/webhooks` and `GET /v1/webhooks`) may return 404 in the sandbox environment. Configure webhooks through the Dashboard instead.
</Warning>

## Webhook Payload

Yuno sends a POST request to your webhook URL with event data:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.updated",
  "data": {
    "id": "payment-uuid",
    "status": "SUCCEEDED",
    "amount": {"currency": "BRL", "value": 100.00},
    "payment_method": {"type": "PIX"},
    "merchant_order_id": "order-001",
    "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:05.000Z"
}
```

## Handling Webhooks

Your webhook endpoint should:

1. Respond with HTTP `200` within 5 seconds
2. Verify the webhook signature (if configured)
3. Process the event asynchronously
4. Be idempotent (handle duplicate deliveries)

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/yuno', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  // Respond immediately
  res.status(200).send('OK');

  // Process asynchronously
  processWebhookEvent(event);
});

async function processWebhookEvent(event) {
  switch (event.event) {
    case 'payment.updated':
      await updateOrderStatus(event.data.merchant_order_id, event.data.status);
      break;
    // Handle other events...
  }
}
```

## Security

- Use HTTPS for your webhook endpoint
- Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- Reject requests that fail signature verification
- Store raw webhook payloads for debugging

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint does not respond with HTTP `200`, Yuno will retry the webhook delivery with exponential backoff.
