## Overview

The Checkout Builder is a no-code visual editor in the Yuno Dashboard that lets you customize the appearance of your Full Checkout and Lite Checkout experiences. Changes apply to all SDK integrations without code modifications.

<Note>
Checkout Builder settings apply as defaults. SDK-level theme configurations passed during initialization will override Checkout Builder settings. See [SDK Customization](/guides/sdk/customization) for programmatic theming.
</Note>

## Accessing the Checkout Builder

Navigate to **Dashboard > Checkout Builder**. The editor displays a live preview on the right and configuration options on the left.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dark Mode

Toggle dark mode in the Checkout Builder to see how your checkout appears in dark themes. You can configure separate color schemes for light and dark modes.

## Mobile Responsiveness

The checkout UI is automatically responsive. The Checkout Builder preview includes device toggles to verify appearance on:

- Desktop (1024px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Mobile (< 768px)

## Reset to Defaults

Click **Reset** in the Checkout Builder to revert all customizations to Yuno's default theme. This action requires confirmation and takes effect immediately upon publishing.

## Exporting Configuration

Export your Checkout Builder configuration as JSON to use programmatically in SDK initialization:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#0066FF",
    "background": "#FFFFFF",
    "text": "#1F2937",
    "borderRadius": "8px",
    "fontFamily": "Inter, sans-serif"
  }
}
```

Copy this into your SDK `theme` configuration for consistent branding across programmatic and Dashboard-managed integrations.
