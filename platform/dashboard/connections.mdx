## Overview

Connections define which payment providers process your transactions. Each connection links a provider (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, Mercado Pago) to your Yuno account with the provider's API credentials.

## Adding a Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Connections">
    Go to **Dashboard > Connections** and click **Add Connection**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a provider">
    Browse the provider catalog or search by name. Providers are grouped by region and supported payment methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter provider credentials">
    Input the API keys or credentials required by the selected provider. Each provider has different credential requirements:

    | Provider Type | Typical Credentials |
    |--------------|-------------------|
    | Card processors | API key, secret key, merchant ID |
    | Local methods | API key, account ID |
    | Bank transfers | API key, branch code |

    <Warning>
    Store provider credentials securely. Yuno encrypts credentials at rest, but ensure you are entering them in the correct environment (sandbox vs. production).
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure payment methods">
    Select which payment methods this connection supports. Available methods depend on the provider and country.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set country availability">
    Specify which countries this connection serves. A provider can be configured for one or multiple countries.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate the connection">
    Toggle the connection to **Active**. Transactions will begin routing to this provider based on your [Routing Rules](/platform/dashboard/routing).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Connections

### Connection Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Accepting transactions |
| **Inactive** | Configured but not processing |
| **Error** | Credential or configuration issue |

### Edit a Connection

Click on an existing connection to modify credentials, payment methods, or country availability. Changes take effect immediately.

### Delete a Connection

<Warning>
Deleting a connection is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure no active routing rules reference the connection before deletion. In-flight transactions will complete through the existing connection.
</Warning>

## Multiple Connections

You can configure multiple connections for the same payment method and country. This enables:

- **Failover:** Route to a backup provider if the primary is down
- **Cost optimization:** Choose the lowest-cost provider per transaction
- **A/B testing:** Compare provider performance

Use [Routing Rules](/platform/dashboard/routing) to control how traffic is distributed across multiple connections.

## Provider Availability

<Note>
Provider availability varies by country and payment method. Contact Yuno support if you need a provider that is not listed in the catalog.
</Note>

## Sandbox Connections

In sandbox, you can use the [Yuno Testing Gateway](/guides/testing/yuno-testing-gateway) as a simulated provider. This is pre-configured in new sandbox accounts and does not require external credentials.
