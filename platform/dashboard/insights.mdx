## Overview

The Insights section provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard for understanding your payment performance. Access it at **Dashboard > Insights** to view transaction trends, identify optimization opportunities, and monitor fraud indicators.

Insights organizes data across four tabs: **Overview**, **Volume**, **Conversion Rate**, and **Fraud**.

## Date Range and Filters

All Insights tabs share a global filter bar at the top of the page:

| Filter | Options | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Date Range** | Preset (Today, 7d, 30d, 90d) or custom picker | Time period for all charts and metrics |
| **Comparison** | Previous period, same period last month/year | Overlay comparison data on charts |
| **Country** | Select one or more countries | Filter metrics by transaction country |
| **Payment Method** | CARD, PIX, BANK_TRANSFER, etc. | Filter by payment method type |
| **Provider** | Select one or more connections | Filter by processing provider |
| **Currency** | ISO 4217 codes | Filter by transaction currency |

<Note>
Filters apply across all tabs. Switching tabs preserves your current filter selections.
</Note>

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level snapshot of your payment performance:

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Volume** | Sum of all transaction amounts in the selected period |
| **Transaction Count** | Number of transactions processed |
| **Approval Rate** | Percentage of transactions with status `SUCCEEDED` |
| **Average Ticket** | Average transaction amount |

### Summary Charts

- **Volume over time:** Daily or hourly transaction amount, with comparison overlay
- **Top payment methods:** Ranked by transaction count or volume
- **Top countries:** Ranked by transaction count or volume
- **Provider distribution:** Pie chart showing transaction share per provider

## Volume Tab

The Volume tab provides detailed breakdowns of transaction activity:

### Transaction Count and Amount

View transaction count and total amount as time-series charts. Toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly granularity.

### Breakdowns

| Breakdown | View |
|-----------|------|
| **By Payment Method** | Stacked bar chart showing volume per method over time |
| **By Country** | Stacked bar chart showing volume per country over time |
| **By Provider** | Stacked bar chart showing volume per provider over time |
| **By Currency** | Table with totals per currency |
| **By Status** | Distribution of transaction statuses (Succeeded, Failed, Pending, Cancelled) |

### Data Table

Below each chart, a sortable data table displays the underlying values. Click any column header to sort. Export the table using the **Export** button.

## Conversion Rate Tab

The Conversion Rate tab helps you understand and improve approval rates:

### Approval Rate Trends

A line chart showing approval rate over time, broken down by:

- **Overall:** Aggregate approval rate across all transactions
- **By Provider:** Compare approval rates across providers to identify underperformers
- **By Payment Method:** Identify methods with lower-than-expected approval rates
- **By Country:** Detect regional approval rate variations

### Decline Reasons

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Top Decline Codes** | Ranked list of decline reason codes with count and percentage |
| **Decline Trend** | Time series of decline volume, segmented by reason |
| **Provider Comparison** | Side-by-side decline rates across providers for the same payment method |

<Note>
Decline reason codes come from the downstream provider. Different providers may return different codes for similar decline reasons. Refer to each provider's documentation for code definitions.
</Note>

### Provider Comparison

A comparison table showing key metrics side by side for each provider:

| Provider | Approval Rate | Avg Response Time | Error Rate | Volume Share |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Provider A | 85.2% | 1,200ms | 2.1% | 60% |
| Provider B | 78.5% | 1,800ms | 4.3% | 40% |

## Fraud Tab

The Fraud tab surfaces risk indicators and chargeback data:

### Key Fraud Metrics

| Metric | Description | Healthy Range |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Chargeback Rate** | Chargebacks as percentage of total transactions | < 1% |
| **Fraud Alert Count** | Transactions flagged by risk conditions | Varies |
| **Risk Score Distribution** | Histogram of transaction risk scores | Skewed low |

### Chargeback Analysis

- **Chargeback rate over time:** Track trends against card network thresholds
- **Chargeback reasons:** Breakdown by reason code (fraud, not recognized, product issue)
- **Chargeback by country:** Geographic distribution of chargebacks

<Warning>
Card networks impose chargeback rate thresholds. Exceeding 1% chargeback rate may result in monitoring programs or penalties. Use the Fraud tab to track your rate proactively.
</Warning>

### Merchant Advisory Codes (MAC)

Merchant Advisory Codes are signals from card networks that indicate potential fraud patterns on your account:

| MAC | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| **Excessive fraud** | Fraud rate above network threshold | Review risk conditions, tighten fraud filters |
| **High chargeback** | Chargeback rate approaching limits | Investigate chargeback reasons, improve dispute management |
| **Unusual activity** | Transaction patterns deviate from baseline | Review recent transactions for anomalies |

When a MAC is issued, it appears as a banner in the Fraud tab with the code, description, and recommended actions.

### Risk Score Distribution

A histogram showing how transaction risk scores are distributed. Use this to:

- Calibrate your risk condition thresholds
- Identify if your risk model is blocking too many legitimate transactions
- Detect shifts in fraud patterns
