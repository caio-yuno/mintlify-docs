## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to the Dashboard">
    Navigate to [dashboard.y.uno](https://dashboard.y.uno) and sign in with your credentials. New accounts start in the sandbox environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your environment">
    Toggle between **Sandbox** and **Production** using the environment switcher in the top navigation bar. Each environment has separate API keys and configurations.

    <Warning>
    Changes made in sandbox do not affect production, and vice versa. Configure both environments independently.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your API keys">
    Go to **Settings > API Keys** to find your `public-api-key`, `private-secret-key`, and `account-code`. You need these for API and SDK integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a provider">
    Navigate to **Connections** to set up at least one payment provider before processing transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Payments Section

The Payments section displays all transactions with filtering and search capabilities:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Status** | Succeeded, Pending, Failed, Cancelled, Refunded |
| **Date Range** | Custom date picker |
| **Payment Method** | Card, PIX, Bank Transfer, etc. |
| **Country** | Filter by transaction country |
| **Provider** | Filter by processing provider |
| **Search** | By payment ID, merchant order ID, or customer email |

Click any transaction to view full details including provider response, timeline, and associated events.

## Environment Switcher

| Environment | Purpose | Real Funds |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Sandbox** | Integration testing and development | No |
| **Production** | Live payment processing | Yes |

<Note>
Always test thoroughly in sandbox before enabling production. The Dashboard provides identical functionality in both environments so your workflow remains consistent.
</Note>
