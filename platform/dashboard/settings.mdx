## Overview

The Settings section in the Yuno Dashboard lets you manage API credentials, invite team members, configure notifications, and control account-level preferences.

## API Keys

Navigate to **Settings > API Keys** to view and manage your credentials.

| Key | Purpose | Visibility |
|-----|---------|------------|
| `public-api-key` | Client-side SDK initialization | Safe to expose in frontend |
| `private-secret-key` | Server-side API authentication | Never expose publicly |
| `account-code` | Merchant account identifier | Required in all API requests |

<Warning>
Your `private-secret-key` grants full API access to your account. Never include it in client-side code, version control, or logs. Use environment variables for secure storage.
</Warning>

### Rotating Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate new keys">
    Click **Rotate Keys** in the API Keys section. New keys are generated immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your integration">
    Replace old credentials in your server configuration with the new keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify functionality">
    Test a sandbox transaction to confirm the new keys work correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Old keys expire">
    Previous keys remain active for 24 hours after rotation to allow for zero-downtime migration.
  </Step>
</Steps>
