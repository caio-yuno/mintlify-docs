## Overview

The Yuno VTEX Plugin connects your VTEX e-commerce store to Yuno's payment orchestration platform. Once installed, Yuno handles payment processing, provider routing, and checkout rendering within your VTEX storefront.

<Note>
The VTEX plugin supports VTEX IO and Legacy CMS stores. Verify your VTEX version before installation.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An active Yuno account with API credentials
- A VTEX store with admin access
- At least one payment provider configured in [Yuno Dashboard > Connections](/platform/dashboard/connections)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Yuno app in VTEX">
    In your VTEX Admin, navigate to **Apps > App Store** and search for "Yuno Payments." Click **Install**.

    Alternatively, install via the VTEX CLI:

    ```bash
    vtex install yuno.payments@latest
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Yuno credentials">
    After installation, go to **VTEX Admin > Payments > Settings > Gateway Affiliations**.

    Click **+** to add a new affiliation and select **Yuno**. Enter your credentials:

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Public API Key** | Your Yuno `public-api-key` |
    | **Private Secret Key** | Your Yuno `private-secret-key` |
    | **Account Code** | Your Yuno `account-code` |
    | **Environment** | Sandbox or Production |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure payment conditions">
    In **VTEX Admin > Payments > Settings > Payment Conditions**, create conditions for each payment method:

    1. Click **+** to add a new condition
    2. Select the payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, PIX)
    3. Choose **Yuno** as the gateway affiliation
    4. Set any additional rules (installments, min/max amount)
    5. Activate the condition

    <Warning>
    Each payment method must have a corresponding payment condition in VTEX. If a method is enabled in Yuno but not configured in VTEX, it will not appear at checkout.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure checkout (optional)">
    For custom checkout rendering, configure the Yuno checkout widget in your VTEX storefront:

    ```json
    {
      "yuno-checkout": {
        "props": {
          "country": "BR",
          "language": "pt",
          "theme": {
            "primary": "#0066FF"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the integration">
    Place a test order in your VTEX store using [test cards](/guides/testing/test-cards). Verify:

    - Payment appears in both VTEX and Yuno Dashboard
    - Order status updates correctly
    - Webhooks are received by VTEX
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Features

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Credit/Debit Cards | Yes |
| PIX | Yes |
| Bank Transfers | Yes |
| Installments | Yes (provider-dependent) |
| Refunds | Yes (from VTEX Admin or Yuno Dashboard) |
| Partial Refunds | Yes |
| 3DS Authentication | Yes |
| Anti-fraud Integration | Yes (via Yuno risk conditions) |

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Payment methods not showing at checkout">
Verify: 1) The method is enabled in Yuno Dashboard > Connections, 2) A payment condition exists in VTEX for that method, 3) The payment condition is active and linked to the Yuno affiliation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Orders stuck in 'Pending' status">
Check webhook configuration. VTEX requires webhooks to update order status. Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in Yuno Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Credential errors">
Ensure you are using the correct environment credentials. Sandbox keys do not work in production and vice versa. Re-enter credentials in the VTEX gateway affiliation settings.
</Accordion>

## Updating the Plugin

Update to the latest version via VTEX Admin or CLI:

```bash
vtex update yuno.payments
```

<Note>
Review release notes before updating. Major version updates may require reconfiguration of payment conditions.
