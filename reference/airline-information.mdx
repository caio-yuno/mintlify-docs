## Overview

Airline transactions (MCC 4511) benefit from providing enhanced Level 2/3 data in the payment request. This additional data can qualify your transactions for lower interchange rates, strengthen chargeback defenses, and meet card network requirements for airline merchants.

## Why Airline Data Matters

### Lower Interchange Rates

Card networks offer reduced interchange rates for airline transactions that include complete passenger and itinerary data. Level 3 data can reduce interchange costs by 0.5-1.0% per transaction, which is significant at airline transaction volumes.

### Chargeback Protection

Detailed passenger and flight information provides strong evidence during chargeback disputes. When a cardholder claims they did not authorize a transaction, the airline can present booking details, passenger name records, and itinerary data as supporting evidence.

### Card Network Compliance

Visa and Mastercard require airline merchants to submit specific data fields with each transaction. Non-compliance may result in higher interchange rates or transaction downgrades.

## Required Airline Fields

| Field | Description | Format | Example |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `passenger_name` | Full name of the primary passenger | String, last/first format | `"SMITH/JOHN"` |
| `ticket_number` | Airline ticket number | 13-digit numeric | `"0012345678901"` |
| `travel_agency_name` | Name of the booking agency (if applicable) | String | `"ACME Travel"` |
| `travel_agency_code` | IATA agency code | 8-digit numeric | `"12345678"` |
| `airline_code` | IATA airline designator code | 2-3 character alpha | `"AA"` |
| `airline_name` | Full airline name | String | `"American Airlines"` |
| `pnr` | Passenger Name Record locator | 6 alphanumeric characters | `"ABC123"` |
| `issue_date` | Ticket issue date | ISO 8601 date | `"2026-03-15"` |
| `departure_date` | Date of first departure | ISO 8601 date | `"2026-04-01"` |

## Leg Data

Each flight segment (leg) in the itinerary requires its own set of data fields. A round-trip flight has at least two legs.

| Field | Description | Format | Example |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `departure_airport` | IATA departure airport code | 3 characters | `"GRU"` |
| `arrival_airport` | IATA arrival airport code | 3 characters | `"MIA"` |
| `departure_date` | Departure date for this leg | ISO 8601 date | `"2026-04-01"` |
| `departure_time` | Departure time | HH:MM (24h) | `"14:30"` |
| `carrier_code` | Operating carrier IATA code | 2-3 characters | `"AA"` |
| `flight_number` | Flight number | String | `"8100"` |
| `fare_basis` | Fare basis code | String | `"Y26NR"` |
| `service_class` | Class of service | Single character | `"Y"` (economy) |
| `stopover_permitted` | Whether stopover is allowed on this leg | Boolean | `true` |

## Passenger Name Record (PNR)

The PNR is a six-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a booking in the airline's reservation system. The PNR links passengers, itineraries, and payment information.

**PNR format rules:**
- Exactly 6 characters
- Uppercase alphanumeric only (A-Z, 0-9)
- Generated by the airline's reservation system
- Example: `ABC123`, `X7YZ9Q`

## API Parameter Structure

<Note>
Not all providers support Level 3 airline data. If a provider does not support it, Yuno will process the transaction without the airline-specific fields. Check with your provider for Level 2/3 data support.
</Note>

<Warning>
Incomplete or inaccurate airline data may result in interchange downgrades (higher fees) rather than the expected savings. Ensure all required fields are populated with accurate booking data.
</Warning>
