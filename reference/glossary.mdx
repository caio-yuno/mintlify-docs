## A

**Account Code**
A unique identifier for your merchant account, required in all API requests as the `account-code` header.

**APM (Alternative Payment Method)**
Any payment method other than traditional credit/debit cards. Examples include PIX, bank transfers, digital wallets, and cash vouchers.

**Authorization**
The first step in a two-step payment flow where funds are reserved on the customer's card but not yet transferred. See [Capture and Cancel](/guides/direct-api/capture-and-cancel).

**Approval Rate**
The percentage of payment attempts that are successfully approved by the provider/issuer. Higher is better.

## C

**Capture**
The second step in a two-step payment flow where authorized (reserved) funds are transferred from the customer to the merchant.

**Checkout Session**
A server-side object that groups transaction context (amount, currency, country) for a payment attempt. Every payment flow starts with creating a checkout session.

**Connection**
A configured link between your Yuno account and a payment provider, including the provider's API credentials and enabled payment methods.

## D

**Decline**
A payment that was rejected by the provider, issuer, or risk engine. Declines are classified as soft (temporary, retriable) or hard (permanent). See [Provider Errors](/troubleshooting/provider-errors).

## E

**Enrollment**
The process of securely storing (vaulting) a customer's payment method for future use. See [Card Enrollment](/guides/sdk/enrollment).

## F

**Full Checkout**
An SDK integration mode where Yuno renders a complete, pre-built checkout UI with all enabled payment methods. See [Full Checkout](/guides/sdk/full-checkout).

## H

**Hard Decline**
A permanent payment decline that will not succeed on retry (e.g., invalid card number, stolen card).

## I

**Idempotency Key**
A unique identifier sent with API requests to prevent duplicate processing. If the same key is sent twice, Yuno returns the original response.

**Issuer**
The bank or financial institution that issued the customer's payment card.

## L

**Lite Checkout**
An SDK integration mode that embeds a lightweight payment form into your checkout page. See [Lite Checkout](/guides/sdk/lite-checkout).

## M

**MCC (Merchant Category Code)**
A four-digit code assigned to merchants by card networks that classifies the type of business. Some issuers restrict transactions based on MCC.

## O

**One-Time Token**
A single-use token generated by the SDK or API that represents sensitive payment data (e.g., card details). Used in place of raw card data when creating payments.

**Orchestration**
The process of routing, retrying, and optimizing payment transactions across multiple providers through a single integration point.

## P

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**
A security standard for organizations that handle card data. Integration type determines compliance level: SAQ-A (SDK) or SAQ-D Level 1 (Direct API).

**Provider**
A payment processor or gateway that Yuno connects to for transaction processing (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, Mercado Pago).

## R

**Routing Rules**
Configuration that determines which provider processes a transaction based on conditions like country, payment method, amount, or card attributes. See [Routing](/platform/dashboard/routing).

## S

**SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)**
A PCI DSS compliance validation tool. SAQ-A is the simplest (SDK integrations); SAQ-D is the most comprehensive (Direct API).

**Sandbox**
An isolated testing environment that simulates payment processing without real funds. See [Sandbox Guide](/guides/testing/sandbox-guide).

**Secure Fields**
An SDK integration mode that embeds individual PCI-compliant card input fields (number, expiry, CVV) as secure iframes. See [Secure Fields](/guides/sdk/secure-fields).

**Soft Decline**
A temporary payment decline that may succeed on retry (e.g., insufficient funds, issuer timeout).

## T

**3DS (3D Secure)**
An authentication protocol for online card payments that adds a verification step (e.g., SMS code, biometric) to reduce fraud. Supported versions: 3DS1 and 3DS2.

**Tokenization**
The process of replacing sensitive payment data with a non-sensitive token. Yuno handles tokenization through the SDK or Tokens API.

## V

**Vaulted Token**
A persistent, reusable token representing a customer's stored payment method. Used for returning customer payments without re-entering card details. See [Card Enrollment](/guides/sdk/enrollment).

**Void**
Cancelling an authorized payment before capture, releasing the hold on the customer's funds. Also referred to as "cancel."

## W

**Webhook**
An HTTP callback that Yuno sends to your server when payment events occur (e.g., payment succeeded, refund completed). See [Webhook Setup](/guides/webhooks/setup).
