## Overview

Merchant Category Codes (MCCs), item categories, and industry classifications affect how payment transactions are processed, what data is required, and what interchange rates apply. This reference covers the codes and categories relevant to Yuno payment integrations.

## Merchant Category Codes (MCC)

MCCs are four-digit codes assigned by card networks that classify a merchant's primary business type. Your MCC affects interchange rates, chargeback rules, and whether certain card types can be used for transactions.

### Setting MCC in Yuno

Your MCC is typically configured at the provider/connection level during onboarding. To update your MCC:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Connections**
2. Select the provider connection
3. Update the merchant category code in the provider settings
4. Contact your Yuno account manager if the MCC field is not editable

Some providers allow per-transaction MCC overrides for marketplace or platform use cases. Check with your provider for support.

## Item Categories

Item categories classify the type of goods or services being sold in a transaction. Some payment methods and providers use this information for risk assessment, tax calculation, and regulatory compliance.

| Category | Code | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| Physical goods | `PHYSICAL` | Tangible items that require shipping | Electronics, clothing, books |
| Digital goods | `DIGITAL` | Intangible items delivered electronically | Software licenses, e-books, streaming access |
| Services | `SERVICE` | Professional or personal services | Consulting, repairs, subscriptions |
| Donations | `DONATION` | Charitable contributions | Nonprofit donations |
| Tickets / Events | `TICKET` | Admission to events or experiences | Concert tickets, museum passes |
| Travel | `TRAVEL` | Travel-related purchases | Flights, hotel bookings |
| Food / Beverage | `FOOD` | Food and drink orders | Restaurant orders, grocery delivery |

Set the item category in the `items[].category` field of the payment request body.
