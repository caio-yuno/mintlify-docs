## Overview

When a payment is processed through Yuno, the response may include codes from multiple layers: Yuno's own error codes, Merchant Advisory Codes (MACs), and raw provider/network response codes. This reference maps these codes to help you understand decline reasons and determine the correct retry strategy.

## Merchant Advisory Codes (MAC)

Merchant Advisory Codes provide standardized guidance on how to handle declined transactions. These codes indicate whether a transaction should be retried and, if so, when.

| MAC | Description | Recommended Action | Retryable |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| `01` | New account information available | Request updated card details from customer via account updater or direct input | No |
| `02` | Try again later / Cannot approve at this time | Retry the transaction after a brief delay | Yes |
| `03` | Do not retry / Do not honor | Do not retry; request alternative payment method | No |
| `04` | Token requirements not fulfilled | Verify tokenization setup and ensure token data is complete | No |
| `21` | Payment cancelled | Customer or issuer cancelled the payment; do not retry | No |
| `24` | Retry after 1 hour | Wait at least 1 hour before retrying | Yes |
| `25` | Retry after 24 hours | Wait at least 24 hours before retrying | Yes |
| `26` | Retry after 2 days | Wait at least 2 days before retrying | Yes |
| `27` | Retry after 4 days | Wait at least 4 days before retrying | Yes |
| `28` | Retry after 6 days | Wait at least 6 days before retrying | Yes |
| `29` | Retry after 8 days | Wait at least 8 days before retrying | Yes |
| `30` | Retry after 10 days | Wait at least 10 days before retrying | Yes |

<Note>
MACs are returned in the `merchant_advisory_code` field of the payment response when available. Not all providers return MACs for every decline.

## Soft vs Hard Declines

Understanding the difference between soft and hard declines is critical for implementing correct retry logic.

### Soft Declines (Retriable)

Temporary conditions that may resolve on retry. Implement exponential backoff with the MAC-recommended delay.

| Condition | Typical Response Code | Retry Strategy |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| Insufficient funds | `51` | Retry after delay; customer may add funds |
| Issuer temporarily unavailable | `91` | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Processing error | `06` | Retry immediately or after brief delay |
| Exceeds withdrawal limit | `61` | Retry after 24 hours or next billing cycle |
| System malfunction | `96` | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Issuer not available | `91` | Retry after brief delay |

### Hard Declines (Do Not Retry)

Permanent conditions that will not resolve on retry. Request an alternative payment method from the customer.

| Condition | Typical Response Code | Action |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| Invalid card number | `14` | Request correct card details |
| Expired card | `54` | Request updated card |
| Stolen card | `43` | Do not retry; flag for review |
| Lost card | `41` | Do not retry; flag for review |
| Card not activated | `78` | Customer must contact issuer |
| Do not honor | `05` | Request alternative payment method |
| Restricted card | `62` | Request alternative payment method |

<Warning>
Retrying hard declines wastes processing resources, degrades your approval rate metrics, and may trigger fraud monitoring by card networks. Always check the decline category before implementing retry logic.

## Provider Response Code Mapping

Yuno normalizes provider-specific response codes into a standardized `decline_reason` field. This allows you to implement consistent decline handling regardless of which provider processes the transaction.

| Yuno Decline Reason | Description | Typical Provider Codes |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Customer has insufficient funds | Visa/MC `51` |
| `INVALID_CARD` | Card number is invalid | Visa/MC `14` |
| `EXPIRED_CARD` | Card has expired | Visa/MC `54` |
| `STOLEN_CARD` | Card reported stolen | Visa `43`, MC `43` |
| `LOST_CARD` | Card reported lost | Visa `41`, MC `41` |
| `DO_NOT_HONOR` | Issuer declined without specific reason | Visa/MC `05` |
| `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` | Fraud suspected by issuer or risk engine | Visa `59` |
| `RESTRICTED_CARD` | Card has restrictions preventing use | Visa/MC `62` |
| `EXCEEDS_LIMIT` | Transaction exceeds amount or frequency limit | Visa `61`/`65` |
| `INVALID_CVV` | CVV verification failed | Visa `N7` |
| `ISSUER_UNAVAILABLE` | Issuer system temporarily unavailable | Visa/MC `91` |
| `PROCESSING_ERROR` | Generic processing error | Visa/MC `06`/`96` |
| `NOT_PERMITTED` | Transaction type not permitted | Visa/MC `57`/`58` |
| `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` | 3DS or PIN authentication failed | Visa `Q1` |
| `STOP_RECURRING` | Customer requested stop of recurring payments | Visa `R0`/`R1` |

<Note>
The normalized `decline_reason` is available in the payment response under `transaction.decline_reason`. Use this field instead of raw provider codes for consistent handling across providers.
