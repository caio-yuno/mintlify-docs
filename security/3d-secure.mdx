## Overview

3D Secure (3DS) is a card network authentication protocol that adds an additional verification step during online card payments. It protects merchants from fraud-related chargebacks through **liability shift** -- when a 3DS-authenticated transaction results in a dispute, the liability shifts from the merchant to the card issuer.

Yuno supports both 3DS 1.0 and 3DS 2.x, with automatic version selection based on issuer capabilities.

## 3DS Versions

| Version | Experience | Authentication | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **3DS 1.0** | Full-page redirect to issuer | Password-based | Legacy (being deprecated) |
| **3DS 2.0** | In-app/in-browser challenge | OTP, biometric, app-based | Current standard |
| **3DS 2.1** | Enhanced risk-based auth | Frictionless flow supported | Current standard |
| **3DS 2.2** | Decoupled authentication | Out-of-band auth supported | Latest |

<Info>
  3DS 2.x introduces **frictionless authentication**, where low-risk transactions are approved without any customer interaction. The issuer evaluates risk signals and may approve the transaction silently, providing the best customer experience while maintaining security.
</Info>

## ECI Indicators

The Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) returned after 3DS authentication indicates the level of authentication achieved:

| ECI (Visa) | ECI (MC) | Meaning | Liability Shift |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 05 | 02 | Fully authenticated | Yes |
| 06 | 01 | Authentication attempted | Yes (partial) |
| 07 | 00 | Not authenticated | No |

<Warning>
  An ECI of 07 (Visa) or 00 (Mastercard) means authentication failed or was not performed. These transactions do NOT receive liability shift and carry the same chargeback risk as non-3DS transactions.
</Warning>

## Integration

### With Checkout SDK

When using Yuno's Checkout SDK, 3DS is handled automatically. The SDK manages the authentication flow, including rendering challenges when required.

```javascript
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "BR",
  currency: "BRL",
  amount: "500.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_abc123",
  // 3DS is handled automatically by the SDK
});
```

### With Direct API

For Direct API integrations, include the `three_d_secure` object in your payment request:

```json
POST /v1/payments
{
  "amount": { "value": 500.00, "currency": "BRL" },
  "country": "BR",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "token": "tok_card_abc123"
  },
  "three_d_secure": {
    "enabled": true,
    "version": "2.2"
  }
}
```

If a challenge is required, the response includes a redirect URL:

```json
{
  "id": "pay_3ds_xyz",
  "status": "PENDING_3DS",
  "three_d_secure": {
    "status": "CHALLENGE_REQUIRED",
    "redirect_url": "https://3ds.y.uno/challenge/pay_3ds_xyz",
    "version": "2.2"
  }
}
```

## 3DS Flow Types

| Flow | Description | Customer Action |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Frictionless** | Issuer approves silently based on risk analysis | None -- seamless experience |
| **Challenge** | Issuer requires customer verification | OTP, biometric, or app confirmation |
| **Fallback** | 3DS 2.x unavailable, falls back to 1.0 | Full-page redirect for password entry |

## When to Use 3DS

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| High-value transactions | Always enable 3DS |
| First-time customers | Strongly recommended |
| Recurring payments (initial) | Enable for enrollment, skip for subsequent |
| Low-risk repeat customers | Consider SCA exemptions |
| Regulatory requirement (PSD2/SCA) | Mandatory in applicable regions |

<Note>
  In regions subject to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulations, such as the European Economic Area, 3DS is mandatory for most card-not-present transactions. See [SCA Exemptions](/security/sca-exemptions) for eligible exemption categories.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Enable 3DS 2.x by default**: It provides better UX than 1.0 with frictionless flows.
- **Send rich data**: Provide browser info, device data, and billing address to increase frictionless approval rates.
- **Handle challenges gracefully**: Ensure your UI accommodates the challenge iframe/redirect without breaking the checkout flow.
- **Monitor authentication rates**: Track frictionless vs. challenge ratios in the Dashboard to optimize data quality.
