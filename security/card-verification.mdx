import { Info, Note, Warning, CodeGroup } from "mintlify/components";

## Overview

Card verification allows you to confirm that a card is valid, active, and belongs to the customer without processing an actual charge. This is done through a **zero-amount authorization** (also called a $0 auth or account verification), where the issuer validates the card details and returns an approval or decline without reserving or capturing any funds.

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Card enrollment** | Verify a card before saving it for future use |
| **Subscription signup** | Confirm card validity before starting a free trial |
| **Wallet top-up** | Validate a card before linking it to a digital wallet |
| **Pre-authorization check** | Ensure a card is active before a high-value transaction |
| **Fraud prevention** | Detect stolen or invalid cards early in the flow |

## How It Works

1. Submit a verification request with the card details (or a vaulted token).
2. Yuno sends a zero-amount authorization to the card issuer.
3. The issuer validates the card number, expiration, CVV, and account status.
4. A verification result is returned: `VERIFIED` or `FAILED` with a reason code.
5. No charge appears on the customer's statement (some issuers may show a temporary $0 hold).

## API Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.y.uno/v1/card-verifications \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'X-Account-Code: YOUR_ACCOUNT_CODE' \
  --data '{
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "CARD",
      "token": "tok_card_abc123"
    },
    "country": "BR",
    "currency": "BRL",
    "customer": {
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

```json Response - Verified
{
  "id": "cv_abc123",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card": {
      "last_four": "4242",
      "brand": "VISA"
    }
  },
  "verification_details": {
    "avs_result": "MATCH",
    "cvv_result": "MATCH"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-02-28T14:00:00Z"
}
```

```json Response - Failed
{
  "id": "cv_def456",
  "status": "FAILED",
  "reason": "CARD_EXPIRED",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card": {
      "last_four": "1234",
      "brand": "MASTERCARD"
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2026-02-28T14:01:00Z"
}
```

## Verification Results

| Status | Description | Next Step |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `VERIFIED` | Card is valid and active | Safe to save or use for payments |
| `FAILED` | Card is invalid, expired, or declined | Prompt customer for another card |

## Failure Reasons

| Reason Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `CARD_EXPIRED` | Card has passed its expiration date |
| `CARD_DECLINED` | Issuer declined the verification |
| `INVALID_CARD_NUMBER` | Card number fails Luhn check or is not recognized |
| `CVV_MISMATCH` | CVV does not match issuer records |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Not applicable for $0 auth (rare) |
| `LOST_OR_STOLEN` | Card reported as lost or stolen |

<Warning>
  Some issuers do not support zero-amount authorizations and will decline the request. In these cases, consider using a small-amount authorization (e.g., $1.00) followed by an immediate void. Check with your provider for issuer support.
</Warning>

## AVS and CVV Results

Card verification responses include Address Verification System (AVS) and CVV check results when available:

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `MATCH` | Data matches issuer records |
| `NO_MATCH` | Data does not match |
| `NOT_CHECKED` | Issuer did not perform the check |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | Issuer does not support this check |

<Info>
  AVS results require the customer's billing address to be included in the verification request. Without address data, AVS will return `NOT_CHECKED`.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Verify before vaulting**: Always verify a card before saving it for recurring use.
- **Handle failures gracefully**: Provide clear error messages when verification fails.
- **Use with 3DS**: Combine card verification with 3D Secure for subscription enrollments.
- **Do not over-verify**: Excessive verification requests on the same card may trigger issuer fraud alerts.
- **Inform customers**: Some issuers show a temporary $0 pending charge. Consider informing customers that this is a verification, not a charge.
