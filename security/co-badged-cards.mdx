title: "Co-Badged Cards"
description: "Handle cards with multiple network brands and let customers or merchants choose the preferred network."

## Overview

Co-badged cards are payment cards that carry two or more network brands, such as a card that is both Visa and Elo, or Mastercard and Maestro. These cards are common in markets like Brazil (Visa/Elo), Europe (Mastercard/Maestro, Visa/V Pay), and other regions where local and international networks coexist.

Yuno detects co-badged cards and allows you to select the preferred network for processing, enabling cost optimization and regulatory compliance.

## How Co-Badging Works

A single physical card can be linked to multiple payment networks. Each network may offer different:

- **Interchange rates** (local networks are often cheaper)
- **Acceptance rates** (international networks may have broader acceptance)
- **Feature support** (3DS, tokenization, installments)
- **Regulatory compliance** (some regulations require offering network choice)

```
Physical Card
    ├── Network 1: Visa (international)
    └── Network 2: Elo (local - Brazil)
```

<Info>
  In Brazil, many cards are co-badged with Elo (local) and Visa or Mastercard (international). Routing through Elo typically offers lower interchange fees for domestic transactions.

## Detecting Co-Badged Cards

When a card is tokenized or used in a payment, Yuno returns all available networks:

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card": {
      "last_four": "7890",
      "primary_brand": "VISA",
      "available_brands": ["VISA", "ELO"],
      "fingerprint": "fp_xyz789"
    }
  }
}
```

## Selecting a Network

### Merchant-Preferred Network

Specify your preferred network when creating a payment:

```json
POST /v1/payments
{
  "amount": { "value": 100.00, "currency": "BRL" },
  "country": "BR",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "token": "tok_card_abc123",
    "preferred_brand": "ELO"
  }
}
```

### Customer Choice (Regulatory Compliance)

In some jurisdictions (notably the EU under PSD2), customers must be given the choice of which network to use. Present the available brands and let the customer select:

```javascript
// Display available networks to the customer
const availableBrands = paymentMethod.card.available_brands;
// ["VISA", "ELO"]

// Customer selects their preferred network
const selectedBrand = customerSelection; // e.g., "ELO"

// Include selection in payment request
const payment = {
  payment_method: {
    token: "tok_card_abc123",
    preferred_brand: selectedBrand
  }
};
```

## Cost Optimization

| Network Type | Typical Interchange | Best For |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Local (Elo, Maestro) | Lower | Domestic transactions |
| International (Visa, MC) | Higher | Cross-border, wider acceptance |

<Warning>
  Not all providers support routing to all networks on a co-badged card. If the preferred network is not supported by your configured provider, the transaction will fall back to the default network.
</Warning>

## Common Co-Badge Combinations

| Region | Combination | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Brazil | Visa + Elo | Very common, Elo has lower domestic interchange |
| Brazil | Mastercard + Elo | Similar cost advantages for domestic |
| Europe | Mastercard + Maestro | Maestro for debit, Mastercard for credit |
| Europe | Visa + V Pay | V Pay for European domestic debit |

## Regulatory Requirements

| Regulation | Region | Requirement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PSD2 | EU/EEA | Merchants must offer cardholder choice of network |
| Brazilian Central Bank | Brazil | Recommended to offer network choice |

<Note>
  When operating in the EU, ensure your checkout flow presents all available networks to the customer. Yuno's Full Checkout SDK handles this automatically when co-badged card support is enabled.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Enable co-badge detection**: Ensure your integration reads the `available_brands` field from card responses.
- **Route to local networks**: For domestic transactions, prefer local networks for lower interchange costs.
- **Comply with regulations**: In regulated markets, present network choice to customers.
- **Test both networks**: Verify that transactions process correctly on each available network.
- **Monitor acceptance rates**: Compare approval rates between networks to optimize routing decisions.
