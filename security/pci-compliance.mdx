## Overview

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security requirements that all organizations handling credit card data must follow. Yuno is a **PCI DSS Level 1 certified** service provider, the highest level of certification. Depending on your integration method, Yuno can significantly reduce or eliminate your PCI compliance burden.

## PCI Scope by Integration Method

| Integration Method | Your PCI Level | Card Data Touches Your Servers | Scope |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Full Checkout SDK** | SAQ A | No | Minimal |
| **Lite Checkout SDK** | SAQ A | No | Minimal |
| **Secure Fields** | SAQ A-EP | No (iframe-based) | Reduced |
| **Direct API (tokenized)** | SAQ A-EP | No (tokens only) | Reduced |
| **Direct API (raw PAN)** | SAQ D / Level 1 | Yes | Full |

<Warning>
  If you handle raw card numbers (PANs) via the Direct API without using Yuno's tokenization, your organization must be **PCI DSS Level 1 compliant**. This requires annual on-site audits and quarterly network scans. Most merchants should use the SDK or tokenization to avoid this requirement.
</Warning>

## SDK Integration (Recommended)

When using Yuno's Checkout SDK (Full or Lite), card data is captured directly by Yuno's PCI-compliant infrastructure. Your servers never see or handle raw card numbers.

```javascript
// Card data captured by Yuno's secure iframe
const checkout = yuno.checkout({
  countryCode: "BR",
  currency: "BRL",
  amount: "200.00",
  checkoutSession: "session_abc123"
});

// Mount renders Yuno's secure payment form
checkout.mount("#checkout-container");

// Your server receives only a token, never raw card data
```

<Info>
  With the SDK integration, Yuno provides a hosted payment form that captures card details in a PCI-compliant iframe. Your frontend and backend only interact with tokenized payment references.
</Info>

## Tokenization

Yuno's tokenization converts sensitive card data into non-sensitive tokens:

| Data Type | Example | Stored by Yuno | Exposed to Merchant |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Full PAN | 4242424242424242 | Encrypted in vault | Never |
| Token | tok_card_abc123 | Reference mapping | Yes (safe to store) |
| Last 4 digits | 4242 | For display | Yes |
| Expiry | 12/2028 | Encrypted | No |
| CVV | 123 | Never stored | Never |

## SAQ Types Explained

| SAQ Type | Description | Typical Merchant |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **SAQ A** | All cardholder data handled by third party | SDK integration merchants |
| **SAQ A-EP** | E-commerce with partial outsourcing | Secure Fields / tokenized API |
| **SAQ D** | Full assessment for direct card handling | Direct API with raw PANs |

## Compliance Requirements by Level

| Merchant Level | Annual Transactions | Requirements |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Level 1 | > 6 million | Annual on-site audit (QSA), quarterly scans |
| Level 2 | 1-6 million | Annual SAQ, quarterly scans |
| Level 3 | 20,000-1 million | Annual SAQ, quarterly scans |
| Level 4 | < 20,000 | Annual SAQ (recommended) |

## Best Practices

- **Use the SDK**: The easiest path to minimal PCI scope.
- **Never log card data**: Ensure your application logs do not capture card numbers, CVVs, or sensitive authentication data.
- **Use HTTPS everywhere**: All pages that include Yuno's SDK or handle payment data must use TLS 1.2+.
- **Restrict access**: Limit access to payment systems and data to authorized personnel only.
- **Regular assessments**: Complete your applicable SAQ annually, even for SAQ A merchants.

<Note>
  Yuno's PCI DSS Level 1 certification is audited annually. You can request Yuno's Attestation of Compliance (AOC) through your account manager for your own compliance documentation.

## Data Storage Rules

| Data | Can Merchant Store? | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-|
| Yuno payment tokens | Yes | Safe, non-sensitive |
| Last 4 digits | Yes | For customer reference |
| Card brand | Yes | For display purposes |
| Full PAN | No (unless Level 1) | Use tokenization instead |
| CVV/CVC | Never | Prohibited by PCI DSS |
| Magnetic stripe data | Never | Prohibited by PCI DSS |
