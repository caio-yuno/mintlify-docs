## General

<Accordion title="What is Yuno?">
Yuno is a payment orchestration platform that connects merchants to multiple payment providers through a single API. Instead of integrating each provider individually, you integrate once with Yuno and gain access to cards, PIX, bank transfers, and other payment methods across Latin America and beyond.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which countries and payment methods does Yuno support?">
Yuno supports payment processing in multiple Latin American countries including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, among others. Supported payment methods include credit/debit cards, PIX, bank transfers, OXXO, PSE, and more. See the [Coverage Matrix](/reference/coverage) for the complete list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between sandbox and production?">
**Sandbox** is an isolated testing environment where no real money is transferred. Use it with [test cards](/guides/testing/test-cards) and sandbox API keys to validate your integration. **Production** processes real payments with real funds. Each environment has separate API keys, provider connections, and configurations.
</Accordion>

## Integration

<Accordion title="Which integration should I choose?">
It depends on your requirements:
- **Full Checkout** -- Fastest setup, Yuno manages the entire UI
- **Lite Checkout** -- Embed a payment form in your page, balance of control and speed
- **Secure Fields** -- Full UI control for card payments, PCI SAQ-A compliant
- **Direct API** -- Complete server-side control, requires PCI DSS Level 1

See [Choose Your Integration](/guides/integration-overview) for a detailed comparison.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need PCI compliance?">
Yes, but the level depends on your integration:
- **SDK integrations** (Full Checkout, Lite, Secure Fields): SAQ-A (simplest self-assessment)
- **Direct API**: SAQ-D Level 1 (most stringent, requires handling raw card data)

If you are unsure about your PCI requirements, use an SDK integration to minimize compliance scope.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle 3DS authentication?">
For SDK integrations, call `yuno.continuePayment()` after creating the payment server-side. The SDK handles the 3DS challenge UI automatically. For Direct API, you must implement the 3DS redirect flow manually based on the `action_url` in the payment response.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use multiple payment providers simultaneously?">
Yes. Configure multiple [Connections](/platform/dashboard/connections) and use [Routing Rules](/platform/dashboard/routing) to distribute transactions across providers based on country, payment method, amount, or other criteria.
</Accordion>

## Payments

<Accordion title="Why is my payment stuck in PENDING status?">
Pending status indicates the payment is awaiting asynchronous confirmation. This is normal for:
- PIX (waiting for customer to scan QR code)
- Bank transfers (waiting for bank confirmation)
- OXXO (waiting for customer to pay at store)

Set up [webhooks](/guides/webhooks/setup) to receive real-time notifications when the payment status changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between cancel (void) and refund?">
- **Cancel/Void**: Releases an authorization hold before capture. No funds were transferred, so no processing fees.
- **Refund**: Returns funds after a payment was captured. Processing fees may apply.

Always prefer cancel over refund for uncaptured authorizations. See [Capture and Cancel](/guides/direct-api/capture-and-cancel).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do refunds take?">
Refund timelines depend on the payment method:
- Credit cards: 5-10 business days
- Debit cards: 3-5 business days
- PIX: Instant to 1 business day
- Bank transfers: 3-7 business days
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="I am getting a 400 error. What should I check?">
400 errors indicate invalid request payloads. Common causes:
1. Missing required fields (check [Error Codes](/troubleshooting/error-codes))
2. Wrong data types (string vs. number, especially for amounts)
3. Invalid formats (currency must be ISO 4217, country must be ISO 3166-1)
4. Malformed JSON syntax

Include the full error response body in your debugging -- the `error.code` and `error.details` fields specify exactly which field failed validation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do webhooks return 404 in sandbox?">
Some webhook event types are not available in the sandbox environment. This is a known limitation. Test with the events that are available and verify full webhook coverage when switching to production.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My SDK is not loading. What should I check?">
1. Verify the SDK package is installed correctly (`npm list @yuno-payments/sdk-web`)
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify your domain is in the allowed origins list (Dashboard > Settings)
4. Ensure you are not blocking third-party scripts with CSP or ad blockers
5. See [SDK Errors](/troubleshooting/sdk-errors) for specific error messages
</Accordion>

## Account

<Accordion title="How do I rotate my API keys?">
Go to **Dashboard > Settings > API Keys** and click **Rotate Keys**. New keys are generated immediately, and old keys remain active for 24 hours to allow zero-downtime migration. See [Settings](/platform/dashboard/settings) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I add team members?">
Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Team > Invite Member**. Enter the email address and select a role (Admin, Developer, Viewer, or Finance). See [Settings](/platform/dashboard/settings) for role permissions.
