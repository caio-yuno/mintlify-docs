## Overview

When a payment is declined, the response includes provider-specific error information. Understanding whether a decline is "soft" (temporary) or "hard" (permanent) determines whether you should retry the transaction or prompt the customer for alternative action.

## Soft vs Hard Declines

| Type | Description | Retry? | Examples |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Soft Decline** | Temporary issue that may resolve | Yes (with backoff) | Insufficient funds, issuer timeout, network error |
| **Hard Decline** | Permanent issue, will not resolve on retry | No | Invalid card number, stolen card, closed account |

<Note>
Retrying hard declines wastes processing resources and can trigger fraud detection systems. Always classify the decline type before deciding to retry.
</Note>

## Common Provider Decline Codes

### Card Declines

| Code | Description | Type | Recommended Action |
|------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| `01` | Refer to issuer | Soft | Ask customer to contact their bank |
| `02` | Refer to issuer (special) | Soft | Ask customer to contact their bank |
| `04` | Pick up card | Hard | Do not retry; card reported lost/stolen |
| `05` | Do not honor | Soft | Retry once; if fails, ask for alternate method |
| `12` | Invalid transaction | Hard | Verify transaction parameters |
| `13` | Invalid amount | Hard | Check amount format and limits |
| `14` | Invalid card number | Hard | Ask customer to re-enter card details |
| `41` | Lost card | Hard | Do not retry |
| `43` | Stolen card | Hard | Do not retry |
| `51` | Insufficient funds | Soft | Inform customer; suggest lower amount or retry later |
| `54` | Expired card | Hard | Ask customer for a valid card |
| `55` | Incorrect PIN | Soft | Ask customer to re-enter PIN |
| `57` | Transaction not permitted | Hard | Card type not allowed for this transaction |
| `61` | Exceeds withdrawal limit | Soft | Suggest lower amount or retry next day |
| `65` | Activity count limit exceeded | Soft | Retry later |

### Network/Gateway Errors

| Code | Description | Type | Recommended Action |
|------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| `91` | Issuer unavailable | Soft | Retry with exponential backoff |
| `96` | System malfunction | Soft | Retry after delay |
| `timeout` | No response from issuer | Soft | Retry; check with provider if persistent |
| `gateway_error` | Gateway processing error | Soft | Retry; check provider status page |

## MCC (Merchant Category Code) Restrictions

Some declines relate to the Merchant Category Code (MCC) assigned to your account:

| Scenario | Cause | Resolution |
|----------|-------|------------|
| "Transaction not permitted" for specific card types | MCC restriction by issuer | Contact Yuno support to verify MCC assignment |
| High decline rates for certain countries | MCC flagged for risk in that region | Review with provider |
| Recurring payment declines | MCC not enabled for recurring | Update MCC configuration |

## Provider-Specific Error Mapping

Yuno normalizes provider errors into standard codes. The raw provider response is available in the payment detail:

```json
{
  "status": "DECLINED",
  "provider": {
    "name": "ProviderName",
    "response_code": "51",
    "response_message": "Insufficient funds",
    "raw_response": { /* provider-specific fields */ }
  }
}
```

## Retry Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Classify the decline">
    Check if the provider code indicates a soft or hard decline using the tables above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Soft decline: retry with backoff">
    ```javascript
    const softDeclineCodes = ['01', '02', '05', '51', '61', '65', '91', '96'];
    if (softDeclineCodes.includes(providerCode)) {
      // Retry after delay, max 3 attempts
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hard decline: do not retry">
    Prompt the customer to use a different payment method or correct their card details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Network retry limits exist. Most card networks allow a maximum of 15 retry attempts within 30 days for the same card and merchant. Exceeding this limit can result in fines from the card network.
</Warning>

## Escalating Provider Issues

If you encounter persistent provider errors not listed here, escalate to Yuno support with:

- Payment ID and `x-request-id`
